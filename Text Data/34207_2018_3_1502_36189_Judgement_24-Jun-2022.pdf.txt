J U D G M E N T  
 
 
 
1. There is a delay of 216 days in filing of this special leave petition 
against the judgment and order dated 5.10.2017 passed by the High 
Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad1 in Criminal Revision Application 
No. 205/2014.  Even though the explanation offered in t he 
application for condonation of  delay  is blissfully vague and bereft 
of any  material  facts  and   particulars,  keeping  in  mind  the  
 
1 for short, “the High Court”  2 
 
subject matter involved, we deem ed it appropriate to ignore /condone 
the delay and proceed ed to hear the matter  on merits.  
2. We must note that the respondents had faintly objected to the 
hearing of this matter on merits owing to unexplained delay in filing 
of the petition .  However, they have a serious objection to the joining 
of Ms. Teesta Setalvad ( as petition er No. 2).  Firstly, because, the 
protest petition on which impugned order ha d been passed and 
assailed in this appeal , was filed only by the  appellant2 – Zakia 
Ahsan Jafri, wife of deceased – Mr. Ehsan Jafri  and on the earlier 
occasion (proceedings before the High Court), it has been ruled that 
she had no locus standi  to join the cause of appellant, which opinion 
has become final as it has not been  reversed by this Court in 
SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008 .  Secondly,  the antecedents of Ms. Teesta 
Setalvad  need to be reckoned and also because she has been 
vindictively persecuting this lis for her ulterior design by exploiting 
the emotions and sentiments of appellant  – Zakia Ahsan Jafri , the 
real victim  of the circumstances .  On the other hand, according to 
Ms. Teesta Setalvad , she is a bonafide crusader of human rights 
 
2 hereinafter, “appellant ” means Zakia Ahsan Jafri only  3 
 
issues and has been following this case closely being fully convinced 
about the cause in quest of justice.  However, as aforementioned, we 
have leaned in favour of examining the merits of the challenge to the 
impugned order (s) at the instance of appellant  - Zakia  Ahsan Jafri .  
For, because of  the subject matter , this Court in the past had to 
invoke  its role of parens patria e in issuing sui generis  direction s 
including in constituting a  Special Investigation Team3 to investigate 
into the matter and to present appropriate report before the 
Metropolitan Magistrate taking cognizance of Crime Report ( CR) No. 
67/2002 dealing with the Gulberg Society, Meghaninagar  case .  
Thus, we do not wish to dilate on the issue of locus  of Ms. Teesta 
Setalvad and keep that preliminary objection open to be decided in 
an appropriate case . 
3. In that light, we have granted leave to appeal and decided to 
examine the matter on merits at the instance of the appellant  – Zakia 
Ahsan Jafri . 
 
 
 
 
3 for short, “SIT”  4 
 
PREFACE  
4. Shorn of  unnecessary factual matrix, this matter essentially 
emanates from the sui generis  direction s given by this Court on 
27.4.20094 in SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008 , whil st considering challenge 
to the decision of the High Court dated 2.11.2007, rejecting the 
prayer of the appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri for issuing  direction to 
the concerned authority to register an FIR o n the basis of complaint 
presented by her  on 8.6.2006 to the Director General of Police, 
Gujarat.  However, this Court vide stated order (dated 27.4.20095), 
directed the SIT appointed by it in terms of the order dated 
26.3.20086, to “look into” the complaint dated 8.6.2006 and take 
steps as required by law and to give its report to this Court within 
three months.  Consequent to such direction, the SIT submitted its 
successive reports on the basis of investigation done by it includ ing 
by taking into account the observations of the Amicus Curiae  
appointed by this Court .  T reating the further report submitted by 
the SIT as analogous to report under Section 173(8) of the Code of 
 
4 2009 SCC Online SC 6  - Jakia Naseem Ahesan & Anr. vs. State of Gujarat & Ors.  
5 supra at footnote No. 4 
6 (2009) 6 SCC 342 – National Human Rights Commission vs. State of Gujarat & Ors.  5 
 
Criminal Procedure7, this Court permitted  the SIT to place it before 
the Magistrate taking cognizance of CR No. 67/2002 concerning trial 
in Gulberg Society case  with further direction to the Magistrate to 
then proceed in accordance with law , including to give opportunity 
to the appellant in the e vent of final report submitted by the SIT was 
to recommend closure of her complaint .  Appellant  – Zakia Ahsan 
Jafri, after being served with the final report dated 8.2.2012 
alongwith relevant materials  adverted to therein , then filed protest 
petition on 15.4.2013.  Thi s protest petition came to be rejected by 
the Metropolitan Magistrate vide order dated 26.12.2013 and 
instead, the final report of the SIT  came to be accepted .  This decision 
was carried before the High Court by way of Criminal R evision 
Application No. 205/2014 .  The revision application came to be  
disposed of  on 5. 10.2017, against which the present appeal arises 
for our consideration.

FACTS  
5. (a) Briefly stated, the abhorrent Godhra incident occurred in 
the morning of  27.2.2002, wherein Kar -sevaks travelling in 
Sabarmati Express train, returning from Ayodhya , were allegedly 
attacked and coaches of the train were set on fire at Godhra Railway 
Station at around 7.45 a.m., as a result of which , 58 persons  were 
charred to death and 59th victim succumbed to the burn injuries on 
3.4.2002.  As aftermath of that incident, there was unrest and 
violence all across the State of Gujarat.  In that process – a violent  
mob attacked the inhabitants of Gulberg Society, Meghaninagar , 
killing 69 persons at the stated location including the husband of 
appellant  – Zakia Ahsan Jafri, who had unsuccessfully attempted to 
dissuade the mob.  In connection with this incident, a crime  was 
registered at “Meghaninagar Police Station ” being CR No. 67/2002.  
Multiple chargesheets were filed against the concerned accused and 
the case was committed to Sessions.  
(b) Since there was widespread  violence  bordering on failure of the 
State machinery to prevent and control the same including to arrest 
all the perpetrators  of the crime and undertake fair investigation, the 7 
 
National Human Rights Commission8 filed a writ petition before this 
Court being W.P.(C rl.) No. 109/2003.  In that writ petition, the Court 
appointed Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel as Amicus Curiae  
vide order dated 9.10.20039.   
(c) This Court vide order dated 21.11.200310, stayed the trial of 9 
(nine) major criminal cases mentioned in the order , including the 
one arising from CR No. 67/2002  concerning the Gulberg Society.

(d) In the subsequent order passed in the group of petition s on 
17.8.2004, this Court directed that in cases where  ‘A’ Summary 
Report (s) had been filed (around 2000 cases) should be further 
investigated by the concerned  Range Inspector  Generals  of Police  in 
the State of Gujarat , who should ascertain the correctness or 
otherwise of such reports.  In this appeal, we are not concerned with 
those cases . 
(e) As noted earlier, this matter emanates from the complaint filed 
by appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri  on 8.6.2006  addressed to the 
Director General of Police, Gujarat  and other high officials  including 
Mr. D.A. Vaghela , P.I., Sector 2 1 Police Station , opposite Old  
Sachivalaya , Gandhi nagar , the Chief Secretary, State of Gujarat, 
Sachivalaya, Gandhi nagar and the Home Secretary, State of 
Gujarat, Sachivalaya, Gandhi nagar.  We shall advert to the contents 
of this complaint in detail a little la ter.   
(f) Broadly stated, in this complaint, appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri 
mentioned names of 63 persons, who according to her, were also 
involved in larger conspiracy and abetment of the crime resulting in 
carnage between February, 2002 and May, 2002, that shook the 10 
 
State of Gujarat .  This allegation was against  the then Chief M inister 
and Ministers of the State, as well as high police officials and 
bureaucrats and others for having committed offence under Section 
302 read with Section 120B, Section 193 read with Section 114  and 
Sections 185, 153A, 186 and 187 of the Indian Penal  Code11 and 
Section 6 of the Commission of Inquiry Act , 195212 and also under 
various provisions of the Gujarat Police Act , 195113 and the Human 
Rights Act, 199114.   
(g) Appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri alongwith Ms. Teesta Setalvad 
being the Secretary of Citizens for Justice and Peace  forum , then 
filed an application before the High Court on 1.3.2007  bearing 
Special Criminal Application No. 421/2007 under Articles 226 and 
227 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482  of the Code .  
During the pendency of the said petition before the High Court, the 
Tehelka Tape surface d, which according to the appellant , unravelled 
the role of the concerned persons being involved in the b uild -up to 
the commission of crime including con spiring and abetting the 
 
11 for short, “IPC”  
12 for short, “the 1952 Act”  
13 for short, “the 1951 Act”  
14 for short, “the 1991 Act”  11 
 
State -wide violence.   Be that as it may, the stated writ petition filed 
before the High Court was finally dismissed on 2.11.2007, in which 
the Court passed the following order: - 
“43.  For the reasons stated above, present petition  is 
dismissed. As the petitioners had not adopted the 
procedure of to file the complaint under section 190 r.w. 
section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the 
petitioner No.1 is relegated to file appropriate private 
complaint to invoke the provisions of s ection 190 r.w. 
section 200 of the Criminal Procedure Code by filing 
the private complaint and the same shall be considered 
in accordance with law and on merits after following 
due procedure under Criminal Procedure Code.  It is, 
however, made clear that this Court has not expressed any 
opinion on the merits of the case in favour of either parties. 
Rule discharged. ” 
(emphasis supplied)  
 
Notably, the High Court did not issue any direction for registration 
of FIR in respect o f the complaint presented by appellant – Zakia 
Ahsan Jafri, dated 8.6.2006.   
(h) Being aggrieved by this decision, the appellant  alongwith Ms. 
Teesta Setalvad  filed SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008, hearing whereof was 
tagged alongwith writ petition filed by the NHRC being W.P.(Crl.) No. 12 
 
109/2003.  Vide order dated 3.3.200815, Mr. Prashant Bhushan, 
learned counsel was appointed as Amicus Curiae  in SLP(Crl.) No. 
1088/2008 to espouse the cause of the appellant  herein .   
(i) When both these matters were listed on 26.3.200816, this Court 
passed the following order: - 
“Order  
 
After having heard learned counsel for the parties, we 
feel that considering the sensitive nature of the cases 
involved, appointment of a Special Investigation Team (in 
short 'SIT') is warranted. Communal harmony is the 
hallmark of a democracy. No religion  teaches hatred. If in 
the name of religion, people are killed, that is essentially a 
slur and blot on the society governed by rule of law. The 
Constitution of India, in its preamble refers to secularism. 
Religious fanatics really do not belong to any reli gion. They 
are no better than terrorists who kill innocent people for 
no rhyme or reason in a society which as noted above is 
governed by rule of law.   
 
These are cases where there is an element of 
communal disharmony, which is not to be countenanced. 
The  State of Gujarat has stated that it has no objection if 
further investigation is done so that peoples' faith on the 
transparency of action taken by the State is fortified.  
 
15       “ORDER  
The High Court’s order does not render the petitioners remedyless.  But, various important aspects arise 
for consideration.  In a given case, a person who has knowledge of the commission  of a crime may not 
be examined by the police.  The question is what is the remedy available to such person?  We, therefore, 
issue notice only to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and the Union of India.  Though, in the proceedings, the 
Central Bureau of Investigati on is respondent No. 3, there is presently no need for issuing any notice to 
the CBI, as we would like to have the views of the Union of India also.  
Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel has agreed to assist the Court as an Amicus -Curiae.  We would 
also request other learned senior members of the Bar to assist the Court, as the question is of vital 
importan ce in the administration of criminal justice.”  
 
16 supra at footnote No. 6 13 
 
  
Mr. Mukul Rohtagi, learned senior counsel appearing 
for the State stated that th e State's approach is fair and it 
is not interested in shielding any culprit or a guilty person, 
but on the other hand, would like all those who are guilty, 
to be punished. This statement of Mr. Rohtagi is not 
accepted by some of the learned counsel appear ing for the 
alleged victims. We need not go into that aspect, in view of 
the fact that there is an agreement that there is need for a 
Special Investigation Team.  
 
We, therefore, direct that an appropriate 
notification shall be issued by the State Government 
regarding the creation of SIT, the constitution of 
which shall be as follows.: - 
1. Shri R.K. Raghavan, retd. Director of the CBI.  
2. Shri C.B. Satpathy, retd. DG, Director, Uttar 
Pradesh,  Police College, Moradabad  
3. Ms. Geeta Johri  
4. Shri Shivanand Jha  
5. Shri Ashish Bhatia  
 
The notification by the State be issued as early as 
practicable, preferably within ten days.  
 
Officers at Sl Nos. 3 to 5 are IG rank officers . Shri 
Raghavan will be the chairman of the committee and Ms. 
Geeta Johri sha ll be the convener. The committee shall in 
its first meeting work out the modalities to be adopted for 
the purpose of enquiry/investigation.  If any person wants 
to make statement before the SIT for giving his or her 
version of the alleged incidents, the SI T shall record it. 
Those who want to give their version shall in writing 
intimate the convenor of the committee so that the 
SIT can call him or her for the purpose of recording 
his/her statement. It is needless to say that the SIT 
shall not confine the inv estigation by recording 
statement of those who come forward to give his or her 
version and shall be free to make such 
inquiries/investigation as felt necessary by it . The 
State Government shall provide necessary infrastructure 
and provide resources for eff ective working of the SIT. The 
report of the SIT shall be furnished to this Court in a 
sealed cover after completion of the 
inquiry/investigation for which three months time is 
granted. After the report is submitted, the further 
action required to be taken  shall be dealt with by this 
Court . The SIT shall conduct inquiries/investigations 
including further investigation in the following cases: - 14

VII. W.P.No.284/2003 TP(Crl.)  No.43/2004 Imran Dawood 
Vs. Union of India.  
 
So far as SLP(Crl.)  No.4409/2003 and Writ 
Petition(Crl.) 216/2003 are concerned, though it is pointed 
out by learned counsel by the State of Gujarat that the trial 
is at concluding stage, in view of th e orders passed in the 
other cases, we feel it would be appropriate if the 
inquiry/investigation including further investigation is 
done, in this case also. The relevant  case No.is FIR 60/02 
commonly known as 'Deepda Darwaza'. So far as Writ 
Petition(Crl.)No.284/03 and T.P.(Crl.)43/2004 are 
concerned, the case is commonly known  as 'British 
Nationals Case' and relates to Himmat Nagar, Prantij P.S 
district Sabarkantta and  relates to FIR 1/26/2002.  
 
We make it clear that SIT shall be free to wor k out 
the modalities and the norms required to be followed for 
the purpose of inquiry/investigation including further 
investigation .  Needless to say the sole object of the 
Criminal Justice System is to ensure that a person who  is 
guilty of an offence is p unished.  
 
Mr. K.T.S. Tulsi, learned senior counsel had submitted 
that in some cases the alleged victims themselves say that 
wrong persons have been included by the police officials as 
accused and the real culprits are sheltered. He, therefore, 
suggested that trial s hould go on, notwithstanding the 
inquiry/investigation including further investigation as 
directed by us. We find that the course would not be 
appropriate because if the trial continues and fresh 
evidence/materials surface, it would require almost a 
de nov o trial which would be not  desirable . 
 
These matters shall be listed for further directions in 
the last week of August, 2008.  
 
The pleadings in all these matters be completed within 
a period of three months. ” 
(emphasis supplied)  16 
 
(j) In furtherance of the above order, the SIT published a public 
notice on 28.4.2008 inviting the public wanting to share information 
and record their statement(s) before the SIT , as notified.  After the 
publication of notice, the SIT started recording statem ents of 
concerned persons willing to depose before it  including others as 
directed by this Court . 
(k)  In due course, the special leave petition filed by the appellant 
being SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008 came up for hearing on 27.4.200917, 
when this Court passed the  following order: - 
“ORDER  
Having heard learned counsel for the parties we direct that  
complaint dated 8/6/2006 which the petitioners herein 
claim to have  sent to the DGP of Gujarat shall be  examined 
by the Special  Investigation Team (in short `SIT') 
constituted pursuant to the  orders of this Court. The SIT 
shall look into the matter and take steps as required 
in law and give its report to this Court within  three 
months.  
Call this matter after three months.  
This case shall be heard along with writ  peti tion (Crl.)  No.  
109 of 2003 and connected cases. ” 
(emphasis supplied)  
 
 
17 supra at footnote No. 4 17 
 
Be it noted that when th is order was passed, it must be assumed , 
that this Court was aware of the fact that the FIR had already been 
registered in connection with Gulberg Society case being CR No. 
67/2002 and the same was committed to sessions for trial of the 
named accused.  Further, the special leave petition filed b y the 
appellant to challenge the order of the High Court refusing to issue 
direction for registration of FIR on the basis of complaint of appellant  
– Zakia Ahsan Jafri , dated 8 .6.2006, was still pending before it.   
(l) Nevertheless, vide judgment dated 1.5.20 0918, this Court  
vacated the stay of the trials and directed the prosecution of cases 
in Special Courts ; and SIT appointed by it  to submit progress report .  
The relevant extract of the said judgment reads thus: - 
“4. Several important aspects need to be noted in these 
cases. Firstly, due to the efforts of SIT, persons who 
were not earlier arrayed as accused have now been 
arrayed as accused. From the details indicated above it 
appears that in most of the cases a large number of 
persons have been additionally made accused. Besides 
this, a large number of witnesses were also examined 
in each case. This goes to show the apparent 
thoroughness with which SIT has wo rked. Therefore, 
SIT shall continue to function until the completion of 
trial in all the cases and if any further 
inquiry/investigation is to be done the same can be 
done as provided in law, more particularly, under 
 
18 (2009) 6 SCC 767 - National Human Rights Com mission vs. State of Gujarat & Ors.  (paras 4, 37 to 40)  18 
 
Section 173(8) of the Code of Criminal P rocedure, 1973 
(in short “the Code ”).

37.  Since the protection of a witness is of paramount 
importance it is imperative that if and when any witness 
seeks protection so that he or she can depose freely in 
court, the same has to be provided. It is therefore 
directed that if a person who is examine d as a witness 
needs protection to ensure his or her safety to depose 
freely in a court he or she shall make an application to 
SIT and SIT shall pass necessary orders in the matter 
and shall take into account all the relevant aspects and 
direct such police  official/officials as it considers 
proper to provide the protection to the person 
concerned. It shall be the duty of the State to abide by 
the direction of SIT in this regard . It is essential that in 
riot cases and cases involving communal factors the tri als 
should be held expeditiously. Therefore, we request the 
Hon'ble Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court to designate 
court(s) in each district where the trial of the cases 
concerned are to be held. The Designated Courts shall take 
up the cases in question.  
38.  Taking into account the number of witnesses and the 
accused persons and the volumes of evidence, it is open to 
the High Court to designate more than one court in a 
particular district. Needless to say that these cases shall 
be taken up by the Designat ed Court on a day -to-day basis 
and efforts shall be made to complete the trial with utmost 
expedition. SIT shall furnish periodic reports if there is 
any further inquiry/investigation.  The State of Gujarat 
shall also file a status report regarding the cons titution of 
the courts in terms of the directions to be given by the 
Hon'ble Chief Justice of the High Court within three 
months. The matter shall be listed further as and when 
directed by this Court.  
39.  …..  The matter was then heard from time to time an d 
an order was then made on 26 -3-2008  directing the 
establishment of SIT, and for a further investigation into 
these matters. The matters under investigation were those 
arising out of  
(a) Crime No. 9 of 2002  
(b) Crime No. 100 of 2002  
(c) Crime No. 23 of 2002  19 
 
(d) Crime No. 98 of 2002  
(e) Crime No. 46 of 2002  
(f) Crime No. 67 of 2002  
(g) Crime No. 60 of 2002  
(h) Crime No. 26 of 2002  
(i) Crime No. 27 of 2002  
The reports of SIT, in respect of each of these 
cases have now been received . 
40.  We have considered the submissions made by Mr 
Harish N. Salve, learned amicus curiae, Mr Mukul Rohatgi, 
learned counsel for the State, Ms Indira Jaising and other 
learned counsel. The following directions are given 
presently : 
(i) Supplementary charge -shee ts shall be filed in each 
of these cases as SIT has found further material and/or 
has identified other accused against whom charges are 
now to be brought . 
(ii) The conduct of the trials has to be resumed on a day -
to-day basis keeping in view the fact that the incidents are 
of January 2002 and the trials already stand delayed by 
seven years. The need for early completion of sensitive 
cases more particularly in cases involving communal 
disturbances cannot be overstated.  
(iii)  SIT has suggested  that the six “F ast Track Courts” be 
designated by the High Court to conduct trial, on a day -to-
day basis, in the five districts as follows:  
(i) Ahmedabad (Naroda Patia, Naroda Gam)  
(ii) Ahmedabad (Gulbarg)  
(iii) Mehsana (for two cases)  
(iv) Saabarkantha opened (British Nationale case)  
(v) Anand  
(vi) Godhra train case (at Sabarmati Jail, Ahmedabad)  
(iv) It is imperative, considering the nature and sensitivity 
of these nominated cases, and the history of the entire 
litigation, that senior judicial officers be appo inted so that 
these trials can be concluded as soon as possible and in 
the most satisfactory manner.  In order to ensure that all 
concerned have the highest degree of confidence in the 
system being put in place, it would be advisable if the 
Chief Justice of  the High Court of Gujarat selects the 20 
 
judicial officers to be so nominated . The State of Gujarat 
has, in its suggestions, stated that it has no objection to 
constitution of such “Fast Track Courts”, and has also 
suggested that this may be left to Hon'ble the Chief Justice 
of the High Court.  
(v) Experienced lawyers familiar with the conduct of 
criminal trials are to be appointed as Public Prosecutors. 
In the facts and circumstances of the present case, 
such Public Prosecutors shall be appointed in 
consultat ion with the Chairman of SIT . The suggestions 
of the State Government indicate acceptance of this 
proposal. It shall be open to the Chairman of SIT to 
seek change of any Public Prosecutor so appointed if 
any deficiency in performance is noticed. If it appe ars 
that a trial is not proceeding as it should, and the 
Chairman of SIT is satisfied that the situation calls for 
a change of the Public Prosecutor or the appointment 
of an Additional Public Prosecutor, to either assist or 
lead the existing Public Prosecu tor, he may make a 
request to this effect to the Advocate General of the 
State, who shall take appropriate action in light of the 
recommendation by SIT . 
(vi) If necessary and so considered appropriate SIT may 
nominate officers of SIT to assist the Public Prosecutor 
in the course of the trial . Such officer shall act as the 
communication link between SIT and the Public 
Prosecutor, to ensure that all the help and necessary 
assistance is made available to such Public Prosecutor.  
(vii)  The Chairman of SI T shall keep track of the 
progress of the trials in order to ensure that they are 
proceeding smoothly and shall submit quarterly 
reports to this Court in regard to the smooth and 
satisfactory progress of the trials . 
(viii)  The stay on the conduct of the tr ials are vacated 
in order to enable the trials to continue . In a number of 
cases bail had been granted by the High Court/Sessions 
Court principally on the ground that the trials had been 
stayed. Wherever considered necessary, SIT can 
request the Public Pro secutor to seek cancellation of 
the bails already granted . 
(ix-i) For ensuring of a sense of confidence in the mind of 
the victims and their relatives, and to ensure that 21 
 
witnesses depose freely and fearlessly before the court, in 
case of witnesses followi ng steps shall be taken:  
 
(a) Ensuring safe passage for the witnesses to and 
from the court precincts.  
(b) Providing security to the witnesses in their 
place of residence wherever considered 
necessary, and  
(c) Relocation of witnesses to another State 
wherever such a step is necessary.  
(ix-ii) As far as the first and the second is concerned, SIT 
shall be the nodal agency to decide as to which 
witnesses require protection and the kind of witness 
protection that is to be made available to such witness . 
(ix-iii) In the case of the first and the second kind of 
witness protection, the Chairman, SIT could, in 
appropriate cases, decide which witnesses require 
security of the paramilitary forces  and upon his request 
same shall be made available by providing nece ssary 
security facilities.  
(ix-iv) In the third kind of a situation, where the 
Chairman, SIT is satisfied that the witness requires to 
be relocated outside the State of Gujarat, it would be 
for the Union of India to make appropriate 
arrangements for the re location of such witness . The 
Chairman, SIT shall send an appropriate request for this 
purpose to the Home Secretary, Union of India, who would 
take such steps as are necessary to relocate the witnesses.  
(ix-v) All the aforesaid directions are to be consid ered by 
SIT by looking into the threat perception, if any.  
(x) SIT would continue to function and carry out any 
investigations that are yet to be completed, or any 
further investigation that may arise in the course of 
the trials. SIT would also discharge s uch functions as 
have been cast upon them by the present order . 
(xi) If there are any matters on which directions are 
considered necessary (including by way of change of Public 
Prosecutors or witness protection), the Chairman of SIT 
may (either directly or  through the amicus curiae) 
move this Court for appropriate directions . 22 
 
(xii)  It was apprehension of some learned counsel that 
unruly situations may be created in court to terrorise 
witnesses. It needs no indication that the court shall have 
to deal with s uch situations sternly and pass necessary 
orders. SIT shall also look into this area . 
(xiii)  Periodic three monthly reports shall be submitted 
by SIT to this Court in sealed covers . 
41.  List after four months. ” 
(emphasis supplied)  
 
It is thus noticed that this Court permitted  trial of concerned (nine) 
cases including the Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 to 
proceed.   This judgment is  also  indicative of the high trust reposed 
by this Court in the SIT including about directing the State 
authorities to abide by the instructions given by the SIT.  
(m)  As directed by this Court vide order dated 27.4.200919, the SIT 
examined the complaint and also recorded statements of the 
concerned persons .  Mr. A.K. Malhotra, former DIG, CBI  and a 
member of the SIT  recorded statements of total 187 witnesses and 
Mr. Himanshu Shukla, DCP , Crime Branch and  I.O., SIT  examined 
145 witnesses , in connection with the  complaint of appellant – Zakia 
Ahsan Jafri, dated 8.6.2006 .  A total of approximately 275 persons 
were questioned by them in compliance with the direction given by 
 
19 supra at footnote No s. 4 and 1 7 23 
 
this Court.  Two new members came to be inducted in the SIT on 
15.5.2009.  When the investi gation into the stated complaint was 
ongoing, the SIT submitted  last supplementary chargesheet in the 
Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 , on 12.8.2009 , which 
fact was placed on record before this Court .   
(n) SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008 then came up for hea ring on 
19.1.2010 alongwith other cases .  The Court was duly informed that 
the SIT had submitted an interim report and asked for five months’ 
further time to complete the investigation in respect of complaint of 
appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri, dated 8.6.200 6.  This Court granted 
time till 30.4.2010.  The order dated 19.1.2010, reads thus: - 
“ORDER  
 
In regard to the investigations in SLP(Crl.) No. 1088 of 
2008, an interim report has been submitted by the Special 
Investigating Team (SIT). In the said report it has been 
reported that having regard to the gravity, complexity and 
vast spread of the allegations across Gujarat State, a very 
large number of suspects and witnesses have to be 
examined. It is also reported that a large number of vital 
documents  are still awaited from the Government of 
Gujarat.  The Committee has prayed for grant of 5 months' 
further time for completion of the enquiry and submission 
of its final report in the matter. The Committee has also 
sought direction to the Government of Gu jarat to hand 
over all the vital documents requisitioned by it from them.  
 
Having perused the correspondence between the SIT  and 
the State Government, filed as annexures with the report,  24 
 
we direct the Government of Gujarat to hand over all the  
documents, w hich have been requisitioned by the SIT 
without  any further delay. The SIT would try to complete 
the enquiry  in the matter expeditiously and submit its 
report by 30th April, 2010.   
 
The report shall be kept in the sealed covers.  
…..”  
 
(o) On 6.5.2010, Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 was 
put on hold because of the resignation of the Special Public 
Prosecutor appearing in that case.  This Court took notice of I.A. No. 
19816/2009 and passed the following order  on 6.5.2010 : - 
“ORDER  
Crl.M.P. No. 19816/2009:  
Having perused the comments submitted by the 
learned Amicus Curiae on the allegations in the 
application (I.A. No. 19816 of 2009), and discussed the 
matter with him and the Chairman SIT at some length, we 
feel that it would be appropriate and e xpedient to direct 
Mr. A.K. Malhotra, D.I.G. (Retd) C.B.I. to examine all police 
records in the possession of the S IT and submit a report 
about the veracity of the explanation given  by the SIT on 
each of the points raised in the said application.  The 
repo rt shall be submitted within eight weeks.  
We further direct that though it seems unlikely 
that the trials would conclude shortly, but if in any one 
of the cases the trial is concluded before the next date, 
the concerned Trial Court(s)  shall not pronounce t he 
final judgment till further orders by this Court . 
List the application along with other listed 
applications for directions on 6th August, 2010.  
A report has been submitted by the Chairman SIT, on 
the letter of Shri Nigam R. Shukla, the Special Public 
Prosecutor, in Naroda Police Station case  (CR.No.98 of 25 
 
2002).  We request the learned Amicus Curia to assist 
the Chairman, SIT in finding out suitable replacements 
for S/Shri R.K. Shah and N.R. Nigam, Special Public 
Prosecutors.   As soon as the name s are finalised by the 
Chairman SIT and communicated to the State 
Government, appropriate orders in that behalf shall be 
issued by the authorities concerned and in both the cases, 
which were being handled by them, shall resume subject 
to the orders, if any , by the Gujarat High Court in transfer 
petition arising from C.R. No. 67 of 2001.  
The progress report in Writ Petition (Crl.) No. 109 of 
2003 filed by the SIT is taken on record.  
The same be kept in the sealed covers.”  
(emphasis supplied)  
In other words, this Court once again passed an interim order in 
respect of trial in Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 , 
directing the trial Court to proceed but not to pronounce the final 
verdict.  On 12.5.2010, the SIT  submitted a report prepared by Mr. 
A.K. Malhotra asking for time for further investigation to enquire into 
the role of Mr. Gordhan Zadafia, the then Minister of State (Home), 
Mr. M.K. Tandon , the then Joint Commissioner of Police, Sector -II, 
Ahmedabad City  and P.B. Gondia , the then DCP, Zone -IV, 
Ahmedabad City . 
(p) This Court , on 26.10.2010 , permitted Mr. Prashant Bhushan, 
learned Amicus Curiae  to withdraw from the case and instead 
nominated Mr. Rohinton Fali Nariman , learned senior counsel  (as he 26 
 
then was) in his place, t o assist the Court.  In addition, the Court 
directed handing over of the reports of Mr. A.K. Malhotra to the 
Amicus Curiae , after taking it on record.  This Court also lifted the 
stay on the pronouncement of the judgment  except  in Gulberg 
Society case being CR No. 67/2002 .  Relevant portion of the said 
order dated 26.10.2010, reads thus: - 
“O R D E R  
SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008  
At the outset, Mr. Prashant Bhushan has expressed 
unwillingness to continue as the Amicus Curiae and requested 
that he may be relieved from the case. We accede to the request 
and appoint Mr. Rohinton Fali Nariman as an Amicus Curiae to 
assist the Court in this case.  
Mr. Bhushan states that he will return the papers of the 
case received from the office in a sealed cover. On receipt of the 
record, the office shall forward the same to Mr. Nariman.   
Report dated 20th October, 2010 on further investigation 
aga inst Shri M.K. Tandan Etc. has been filed by the Chairman 
and one of the Members of the Special Investigation Team. 
According to the report, the investigation is likely to be

(emphasis supplied)  
(q) The further report filed in this case had mentioned  that most 
of the allegations were not borne out  from the statements and 
materials collated during investigation.  However, it was 
recommended that further investigation under Section 173(8) of the 
Code in respect of Mr. Gordhan Zad afia, Mr. M.K. Tandon  and Mr. 
P.B. Gondia, may be necessary .  Notably, t he further investigation 
was conducted by Mr. Himanshu Shukla , DCP, Crime Branch and 
I.O., SIT  and report was submitted by him to this Court on 
17.11.2010.  
(r) As noticed earlier, on one hand, the trial concerning Gulberg 
Society case being CR No. 67/2002  invo lving the gruesome killing of 
the husband of the appellant and others by a violent mob  was 
allowed to proceed by this Court even when the SIT was enquiring 
into the complaint of appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri, dated 8.6.2006 ; 
and in that process, the deposition of Mr. Ashish Khaitan , senior 
journalist (who had conducted the Tehelka Sting Operation)  was 29 
 
recorded by the trial Court on 2.8.2010, of Mr. Rahul Sharma on 
15.9.2010 and of appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri on 22.10.2010.   
(s) Further investigation report came to be submitted before this 
Court by Mr. Himanshu Shukla on 17.11.2010.   On 23.11.201020, 
Mr. Rohinton Fali Nariman, learned Amicus Curiae  requested the 
Court to allow him  to withdraw from the case.  That request was 
acceded to by the Court and in his place, Mr. Raju Ramchandran 
was appointed as Amicus Curiae  to be assisted by Mr. Gaurav 
Agrawal, learned counsel.   The Court also directed hand ing over to 
both  the newly appointed Amicus Curiae , the reports of SIT .  The 
Amicus Curiae  in turn examine d the SIT reports concerning 
complaint of appellant, dated 8.6.2006 , and placed their 
observations on record in the form of a note made over to the SIT .  
This Court then vide order dated 20.1.2011, directed thus: - 
“ORDER  
W.P.(CRL.)NO. 109/2003  
Mr. Harish N. Salve, the learned amicus curiae, has  
placed before us a note, pointing out that the  Presiding 
 
20       “ORDER  
 
Since Mr. Rohinton Fali Nariman, Senior Advocate has expressed his inability to assist the Court in this case, we 
request Mr. Raju Ramachandran, Senior Advocate and Mr. Gaurav Agarwal, Advocate, to assist the Court in this 
case as Amicus Curiae. All the papers received back from Mr. Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel, in sealed cover 
shall be forwarded to Mr. Gaurav Agarwal.”  30 
 
Judge conducting trial in Naroda Police  Station I.CR 
No.100/2002, has since been transferred by the  High 
Court in routine transfers of the Judicial Officers  in the 
State. Learned amicus suggests that since the trial in  the 
said case is at an advanced stage, the Officer may not be  
shifted.  
 
We feel that it wi ll be proper and expedient if this  
request is made by  the Chairman, Special Investigation  
Team (SIT) before the Chief Justice of  Gujarat High Court  
on the administrative side. We are confident that having  
regard to the fact situation, the learned Chief Jus tice will  
pass appropriate orders on the request of the Chairman, 
SIT.   
 
A Progress Report, dated 18th January, 2011, 
regarding  nine under trial cases has been filed by the 
Chairman,  SIT. It appears from the said report that except

In response to which she had to give assurance to this Court that in 
future  she will not repeat the act of forwarding letters written by her 
to SIT to the said organisation (OHCHR) and on such assurance, the 
issue stood closed.  32 
 
(t) The matters were then listed on 15.3.2011, when Mr. Raju 
Ramchandran,  learned  Amicus Curiae  submitted a note, which had 
already been supplied to the Chairman , SIT.  The Court directed the 
Chairman , SIT to look into the observations made by the Amicus 
Curiae  against each of the findings made by the SIT.  The order reads

(u) What is significant to notice is order dated 5.5.2011 passed by 
this Court.  The same reads thus: - 
“ORDER  
 
SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2018  
Pursuant to our order dated 15th March, 2011, the 
Chairman, Special Investigation Team (SIT) has filed report 33 
 
on the further investigations carried out by his team along 
with his remarks thereon.   Statements of witnesses as also 
the documents have been placed on record in separate volume s.  
Let a copy of all these documents along with the report of the 
Chairman be supplied to Mr. Raju Ramachandran, the learned 
Amicus Curiae.  
 The learned Amicus Curiae shall examine the report, 
analyse and have his own independent assessment of the 
statements of the witnesses recorded by the S IT and submit 
his comments thereon.  It will be open to the learned 
Amicus Curiae to interact with any of the witnesses, who 
have been examined by the SIT, including the police 
officers, as he may deem fit.  
 If the learned Amicus Curiae forms an opinion that on 
the basis of the material on record, any offence is made out 
against any person, he shall mention  the same in his report . 
 List on 28th July, 2011 at 3.00 p.m.  
 
CRL.M.P. Nos.  21849/2009 and 21850/2009 in S LP(CRL.) No. 
1088 /2008  
 At the request of learned counsel for the applicants, 
adjourned to 28th July, 2011 at 3.00 p.m. for preliminary 
hearing.  
 
SLP(CRL.) NO. 1032/2011  
 Learned counsel for the respondents submit that they do 
not propose to file any counter affidavit to the petition.  
 List the matter for final disposal on 28th July, 2011 at 3.00 
p.m.  
 All the reports shall be kept in a sealed cover.”  
(emphasis supplied)  
In terms of this order, Mr. Raju Ramchandran, learned Amicus 
Curiae  was granted li berty to examine the SIT report, analyse the 
same and give his own independent assessment of the statement of 
witnesses recorded by the SIT and submit his comments thereon.  34 
 
For doing that, he was also permitted to interact with any of the 
witnesses, who h ad been examined by the SIT including the police 
officials, as he may deem fit.  In this two -month period, the Amicus 
Curiae  had interacted with all concerned, as he desired including 
with Ms. Teesta Setalvad.  This direction was in the nature of 
permitting the Amicus Curiae  to do appraisal of the actions of the 
investigator (SIT) appointed by this Court.  This was an extra effort 
not only expected from the Amicus Curiae , but also for reassuring 
the Court that each al legation in the complaint dated 8.6.2006 is 
dealt with appropriately in the report submitted by the SIT.  The 
learned Amicus Curiae , after analysing the entire material including 
the reports, then submitted his report on 25.7.2011.    
(v) After the report was submitted by Amicus Curiae  on 25.7.2011, 
the SIT  submitted  its further report after investigation including to 
deal  with the observations of the Amicus Curiae  on every  aspect 
noted in his report.   This further report of the SIT was pla ced before 
this Court on 12.9.2011.  This Court being satisfied with the fact 
that investigation ha d been completed by the SIT under its 
supervision, following the decision in Bhagwant Singh vs . 35 
 
Commissioner of Police & Anr.21, as well as, Vineet Nara in & 
Ors. vs. Union of India  & Anr .22, Union of India & Ors. vs. Sushil 
Kumar Modi  & Ors.23, M.C. Mehta (Taj Corridor Scam) vs. Union 
of India & Ors.24 and Narmada Bai vs. State of Gujarat & Ors.25, 
proceeded to pass the following order  on 12.9.201126: - 
“.….  
8. The learned amicus curiae has now submitted his final 
report dated 25 -7-2011. In light of the above conspectus 
and the report of the learned amicus curiae, the question 
for determination is the future course of action in the 
matt er. 
9. We are of the opinion that bearing in mind the scheme 
of Chapter XII of the Code, once the investigation has 
been conducted and completed by SIT, in terms of the 
orders passed by this Court from time to time , there is 
no course available in law, sav e and except to forward 
the final report under Section 173(2) of the Code to the 
court empowered to take cognizance of the offence 
alleged . As observed by a three -Judge Bench of this Court 
in M.C. Mehta (Taj Corridor Scam)  v. Union of India , (2007) 
1 SCC 110, in cases monitored by this Court, it is 
concerned with ensuring proper and honest 
performance of its duty by the investigating agency 
and not with the merits of the accusations in investigation, 
which are to be determined at the trial on the filing of the 
charge -sheet in the competent court, according to the 
ordinary procedure prescribed by law.  
10.  Accordingly, we direct the Chairman, SIT to 
forward a final report, along with the entire material 
collected by SIT, to the court which had ta ken 
 
21 (1985) 2 SCC 537 (paras 4 and 5)  
22 (1996) 2 SCC 199  
23 (1998) 8 SCC 661  
24 (2007) 1 SCC 110  
25 (2011) 5 SCC 79  
26 (2011) 12 SCC 302  – Jakia Naseem Ahesan & Anr. vs. State of Gujarat & Ors.  36 
 
cognizance of Crime Report No. 67 of 2002, as required 
under Section 173(2) of the Code. Before submission of 
its report, it will be open to SIT to obtain from the 
amicus curiae copies of his reports submitted to this 
Court. The said court will deal wi th the matter in 
accordance with law relating to the trial of the 
accused, named in the report/charge -sheet, including 
matters falling within the ambit and scope of Section 
173(8) of the Code . 
11.  However, at this juncture, we deem it necessary to 
emphasis e that if for any stated reason SIT opines  in its 
report, to be submitted in terms of this order, that there 
is no sufficient evidence or reasonable grounds for 
proceeding against any person named in the complaint 
dated 8 -6-2006 , before taking a final deci sion on such 
“closure” report, the court shall issue notice to the 
complainant and make available to her copies of the 
statements of the witnesses, other related documents and 
the investigation report strictly in accordance with law as 
enunciated by this C ourt in  Bhagwant Singh  v. Commr. of 
Police , (1985) 2 SCC 537. For the sake of ready reference, 
we may note that in the said decision, it has been held that 
in a case where the Magistrate to whom a report is 
forwarded under Section 173(2)( i) of the Code, de cides not 
to take cognizance of the offence and to drop the 
proceedings or takes a view that there is no sufficient 
ground for proceeding against some of the persons 
mentioned in the FIR, the Magistrate must give notice to 
the informant and provide him an opportunity to be heard 
at the time of consideration of the report.  
12.  Having so directed, the next question is whether this 
Court should continue to monitor the case any further. 
The legal position on the point is made clear by this Court 
in Union of Ind ia v. Sushil Kumar Modi , (1998) 8 SCC 661, 
wherein, relying on the decision in  Vineet Narain  v. Union 
of India , (1996) 2 SCC 199, a Bench of three learned 
Judges had observed thus ( Sushil Kumar Modi case , (1998) 
8 SCC 661 : 
“6. … that once a charge -sheet is filed in the 
competent court after completion of the 
investigation, the process of monitoring by this 
Court for the purpose of making CBI and other 
investigative agencies concerned perform their 
function of investigating into the offences 37 
 
concerned comes to an end; and thereafter it is 
only the court in which the charge -sheet is filed 
which is to deal with all matters relating to the 
trial of the accused, including matters falling 
within the scope of Section 173(8) of the Code of 
Criminal Pr ocedure. We make this observation 
only to reiterate this clear position in law so that 
no doubts in any quarter may survive.”  
13.  In M.C. Mehta  v. Union of India , (2008) 1 SCC 407, a 
question arose as to whether after the submission of the 
final report by CBI in the Court of Special Judge, pursuant 
to this Court's directions, this Court should examine the 
legality and validity of CBI's action in seeking a sanction 
under Section 197 of the Code for the prosecution of some 
of the persons named in the final re port. Dismissing the 
application moved by the learned amicus curiae seeking 
directions in this behalf, a three -Judge Bench, of which 
one of us (D.K. Jain, J.) was a member, observed thus :  
“9. … The jurisdiction of the court to issue a writ 
of continuous mandamus is only to see that 
proper investigation is carried out. Once the court 
satisfies itself that a proper investigation has been 
carried out, it would not venture to take over the 
functions of the Magistrate or pass any order 
which would i nterfere with his judicial functions. 
Constitutional scheme of this country envisages 
dispute resolution mechanism by an independent 
and impartial tribunal. No authority, save and 
except a superior court in the hierarchy of 
judiciary, can issue any directi on which otherwise 
takes away the discretionary jurisdiction of any 
court of law. Once a final report has been filed in 
terms of sub -section (1) of Section 173 of the Code 
of Criminal Procedure, it is the Magistrate and 
Magistrate alone who can take approp riate 
decision in the matter one way or the other. If he 
errs while passing a judicial order, the same may 
be a subject -matter of appeal or judicial review. 
There may be a possibility of the prosecuting 
agencies not approaching the higher forum 
against an order passed by the learned 
Magistrate, but the same by itself would not 
confer a jurisdiction on this Court to step in.”  38 
 
14.  Recently, similar views have been echoed by this Court 
in Narmada Bai  v. State of Gujarat , (2011) 5 SCC 79. In 
that case, dealing with the question of further monitoring 
in a case upon submission of a report by CBI to this Court, 
on the conclusion of the investigation, referring to the 
earlier decisions in  Vineet Narain , (1996) 2 SCC 
199,  Sushil Kumar Modi , (1998) 8 SCC 661  and  M.C. Mehta 
(Taj Corridor Scam) , (2007) 1 SCC 110, speaking for the 
Bench, one of us, (P. Sathasivam, J.) has observed as 
under: ( Narmada Bai case , (2011) 5 SCC 79 : 
“70. The above decisions make it clear that 
though this Court is competent to entrust the 
investigation to any independent agency, once the 
investigating agency complete their function of 
investigating into the offences, it is the court in 
which the charge -sheet is filed which is to deal 
with all matters relating to the trial of the accused 
inclu ding matters falling within the scope of 
Section 173(8) of the Code. Thus, generally, this 
Court may not require further monitoring of the 
case/investigation. However, we make it clear 
that if any of the parties including CBI require any 
further direction,  they are free to approach this 
Court by way of an application.”  
15.  Deferentially concurring with the dictum of this Court 
in the aforenoted decisions, we are of the opinion that in 
the instant case we have reached a stage where the process 
of monitoring of the case must come to an end. It would 
neither be desirable nor advisable to retain further seisin 
over this case. We dispose of this appeal accordingly.  
….. ” 
(emphasis supplied)  
(w)  As per the direction given by this Court, the SIT presented  its 
final report on 8.2.2012 before the concerned Metropolitan 
Magistrate , who had taken cognizance of Gulberg Society case being 
CR No. 67/2002.  39 
 
(x) It appears that the appellant corresponded with the SIT, as well 
as, the Magistrate for supplying certain document s.  The Magistrate 
vide order dated 10.4.2012 , directed supply of partial documents 
and on 16.5.2012, he rejected the request for granting rest of the 
documents including enquiry report, further investigation report 
and statements  enclosed  therewith .   
(y) This led to filing of SLP(Crl.) No. 8989/2012.  This petition  was 
finally allowed on 7.2.2013 being converted into Criminal Appeal No. 
273/2013.  The order reads thus:  -  
“ORDER  
Heard all the parties concerned including Mr. Raju 
Ramachandran, learned Amicus Curiae.  
 Leave granted.  
 The complainant is the appellant.  She filed an 
application before the Metropolitan Magistrate claiming 
supply of all the documents filed along with the closure 
report dated 07.10.2012 by the SIT.  
 Before considering the claim of the appellant, it is 
relevant to refer to the earlier order of this Court dated 12th 
September, 2011 made in Criminal Appeal No. 1765 of 
2011.  After going into various aspects, this Court issued 
the following directions to the S IT: 
“Accordingly, we direct the Chairman, SIT to 
forward a final report, along with the entire 
material collected by SIT, to the court which had 
taken cognizance of Crime Report No. 67 of 2002, 
as required under Section 173(2) of the Code. 
Before submission of its report, it will be open to 40 
 
SIT to obtain from the Amicus Curie s copies of his 
reports submitted to this Court. The said Court 
will deal with the matter in accordance with law 
relating to the trial of the accused, named in the 
report/charge -sheet, in cluding matters falling 
within the ambit and scope of Section 173(8) of 
the Code.  However, at this juncture, we deem it 
necessary to emphasise that if for any stated 
reason the SIT opines in its report, to be 
submitted in terms of this order, that there i s no 
sufficient evidence or reasonable grounds for 
proceeding against any person named in the 
complaint , dated 8 -6-2006, before taking a final 
decision on such ‘closure ’ report, the Court shall 
issue notice to the complainant and make 
available to her copies of the (1) statements of the 
witnesses, (2) related documents and (3) 
investigation report strictly in accordance with 
law as enunciated by this Court in  Bhagwant 
Singh  v. Commr. o f Police  & Anr.  [(1985) 2 SCC 
537.  For the sake of ready reference, we may note 
that in the said decision, it has been held that in 
a case where the Magistrate to whom a report is 
forwarded under Section 173(2)( i) of the Code, 
decides not to take cognizan ce of the offence and 
to drop the proceedings or takes a view that there 
is no sufficient ground for proceeding against 
some of the persons mentioned in the FIR, the 
Magistrate must give notice to the informant and 
provide him an opportunity to be heard at  the 
time of consideration of the report. ” 
Pursuant to the above direction, the SIT submitted a 
final report to the Court concerned .  Before the said Court, 
the appellant/complainant made an application for supply 
of all the materials filed before the said Court.  According 
to the appellant, pursuant to the directions of the 
Magistrate though she was supplied certain materials, still 
the SIT has not provided all the required documents.  Not 
satisfied with the order of the learned Magistrate, the 
appella nt has filed this appeal.  
 We have heard learned counsel appearing for the 
appellant, State as well as the learned Amicus Curiae.  
 On going into the earlier direction of this Court as well 
as the impugned order passed by the Magistrate, we issue 41 
 
the follow ing directions.  The appellant is entitled to have 
copies of the report dated May 12, 2010 in two volumes, 
excluding the Chairman’s comments forwarded to this 
Court.  The appellant is also entitled to have copies of 
reports dated November 17, 2010 and Apri l 24, 2011 filed 
under Section 173(8) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 
1973.  
 Since the statements recorded contain signature, 
it is clarified that if the signed statements are 
supplied, the same shall be treated as statements made 
under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 
1973.  
 It is further clarified that the statements recorded 
in the inquiry shall only be used in the proceedings 
relating to the complaint dated June 8, 2006 filed by 
the appellant and shall not be used for any other 
purpose or in connection with any other case.  We also 
clarify that the present order is confined to the facts 
and circumstances of the complaint dated 8th June, 
2006 and shall not be treated as a precedent, in any 
other case . 
 The appellant is granted eight weeks’ t ime for filing 
the protest petition from the date she gets the required 
copies as mentioned above.  
 In view of the above conclusion and direction, the 
impugned orders of the learned Magistrate dated 
16.07.2012 and 27.11.2012 are set aside to the extent 
mentioned above.  The appeal is disposed of in the above 
terms.”  
(emphasis supplied)  
  
This order, besides issuing directions, as prayed regarding 
furnishing of documents, also clarifie d the position that the 
statements recorded by the SIT pursuant to the investigation 
undertaken after 27.4.2009 in respect of the allegations in complaint 
dated 8.6.2006, be treated as statements of witnesses under Section 42 
 
161 of the Code, which, however, c annot be used for any other 
purpose including the trial of Gulberg Society case being CR No. 
67/2002 . 
(z) Only after getting all the material  accompanying the report , 
appellant  – Zakia Ahsan Jafri  proceeded to file a protest petition on 
15.4.2013 before the Me tropolitan Magistrate.  The Magistrate, after 
considering the protest petition and the final report of the SIT dated 
8.2.2012, by a speaking order dated 26.12.2013, rejected the protest 
petition filed by appellant and accepted the final (closure ) report fi led 
by the SIT and passed consequential order.  
(aa)  Against this decision, appellant carried the matter before the 
High Court by way of the stated criminal revision  application , which 
came to be disposed of vide impugned judgment and order dated 
5.10.2017 , with liberty to appellant to agitate the issue of further 
investigation upon availability of new material/information.   Against 
the said decision, the present appeal from special leave has been 
filed . 
(bb)  To complete the narration of relevant facts,  we may also advert 
to the order passed by this court on 13.4.2017  in W.P.(Crl.) No. 43 
 
109/2003 , commending the efforts of the SIT  as well , while relieving 
the Chairman  of the SIT from his responsibility.  The said order 
reads thus: - 
“O R D E R  
1. While pla cing on record our appreciation for the services 
rendered to this Court by the learned Amicus Curiae, we are 
immensely satisfied with the manner in which the proceedings 
had been conducted in all the trials, resulting in the conclusion 
of all but one trial .  
2. Learned Amicus Curiae has made a request on behalf of Shri 
R.K. Raghavan, the Chairman of the Special Investigation Team 
(SIT), seeking to withdraw from the SIT hereinafter, on account 
of his ill health. We appreciate the request made, and release 
him from his responsibility as the Chairman of the SIT.  
3. A similar request has been made for the release of Shri K. 
Venkatesham. The instant request is based on the fact, that 
Shri K. Venkatesham has since been appointed as 
Commissioner of Police, Nagpur,  and therefore, his onerous 
responsibility leaves him limited time to deal with other issues. 
For the reasons brought to our notice, we hereby 1 relieve Shri 
K. Venkatesham from the duties vested in him as a member of 
the SIT.  
4. In the above view of the matter, we would request the 
remaining member of the SIT, namely, Shri A.K. Malhotra, to 
continue to discharge the responsibility hereto before entrusted 
to the SIT, himself. Shri A.K. Malhotra shall furnish quarterly 
reports to this Court.  
5. Post for he aring in the last week of July, 2017.”  
 
 
 44 
 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE APPELLANT  
6. (a) The thrust of the argument was broadly two pronged.   The 
first being the SIT has jumped to the conclusion that no offence is 
made out against the persons named in the complaint/protest 
petition despite material and statements collated by it during 
investigation  indicating to the contrary .  Additionally, the failure of 
the SIT to investigate into crucial allegations/material referred to in 
the protest petition.  
(b) The secon d is about the failure of the Metropolitan Magistrate  
in exercising the powers  vested in him  including to take cognizance 
of the offence and in not directing further investigation by the SIT in 
respect of certain matters.   Even the High Court has committed the 
same fatal error .  Reliance is placed on Vishnu Kumar Tiwari vs. 
State of Uttar Pradesh  & Anr.27, to buttress these points.   As held 
in Abhinandan Jha & Ors. vs. Dinesh Mishra28, there is no 
obligation on the Magistrate to accept the final report.  It is open to 
the Magistrate to take cognizance if he is so satisfied by invoking 
 
27 (2019) 8 SCC 27  (paras 7, 17, 27, 28, 32, 33 and 42)  
28 AIR 1968 SC 117 = 1967 (3) SCR 668 (at page 678)  (para 15 and 21 ) 45 
 
powers under Section 190(1)(c)  of the Code including to direct 
further investigation.  
(c) The appellant in the protest petition had articu lated broad 
grounds on which final SIT report was being opposed.  The same 
read thus: - 
“31. The Petitioner submits that the Closure Report needs to be 
rejected and the Protest Petition allowed on the following 
grounds, which are in addition to the reasons and grounds set 
out elsewhere in this Petition:  
 
a) The Documents and annexures as submitted by the 
SIT along with the closure report make out a clear case 
for taking cognizance against all the accused;  
b) Without prejudice to the above, the SIT wh ile 
investigating, has not examined all the necessary 
witnesses or called for all the necessary documents as 
set out in the Petition. In view of this the Investigation 
is defective and incomplete. Further investigation 
therefore needs to be ordered to arri ve at the whole 
truth;  
c) Without prejudice to the above, the SIT's analysis of 
the statements of witnesses and other documents is 
hopelessly biased, inaccurate, and suffers from total 
non application of mind.  
d) SIT has taken great pains to disbelieve and  discredit 
any witnesses who have spoken against the Accused 
No.1 or for that matter against any accused. Besides, 
the witnesses who were favouring Accused were not 
confroned with relevant documents and statements.  
e) SIT was required to ascertain whether there is any 
substance to proceed against the accused persons and 
once it comes to the conclusion that such substance 
exists it should have proceeded to file a Charge Sheet. 
Such substance exists against all the accused. There 46 
 
are witnesses and documents t o cast reasonable doubt 
against the conduct of all the accused and pointing 
towards their culpability. For instance, the statements 
of senior officers like RB Sreekumar, Rahul Sharma, 
Sanjiv Bhatt as well as the Tehelka tapes (validated by 
the Sessions Cou rt) are enough to file a charge sheet/ 
take cognizance. Instead of doing this, the SIT has acted 
like a super court dissecting every bit of evidence, 
turning and twisting it, ignoring relevant material and 
accepting uncorroborated irrelevant material to 
somehow whitewash this entire exercise. Worse the SIT 
has deliberately and manifestly ignored the huge 
voluminous evidence that is available on record. SIT has 
acted beyond its jurisdiction as an Investigating Agency. 
In fact this Hon'ble Court ought to disr egard the SIT 
Report altogether and look at the gathered evidence 
independently to arrive at the conclusion that 
cognizance ought to be taken.  
f) Apart from anything it needs to be verified whether 
the Closure Report is based on a collective application 
of mind by SIT as a whole or not. Large number of 
documents/ statements are in Gujarati. Admittedly 
they have not been translated. Majority of the SIT 
members cannot read Gujarati. In order to decide the 
weight to be attributed to each of the s tatements/ 
document it was necessary that the SIT, as a collective 
applied its mind to these documents. In the absence of 
any translations it is not clear as to how the SIT has 
come to the conclusions it has arrived at.  
g) The Petitioner submits that again st each of the 
accused there is sufficient material to take cognizance 
of offences of conspiracy and abetment, subversion of 
public justice, destruction and suppression of evidence, 
of rioting, theft, robbery, murder, attempt to commit 
murder, etc. Besides , against many of the accused 
Charge Sheets should have also been filed for hate 
speech.  
h) SIT should have considered that once a public 
servant is held to be negligent in performing his duties, 
and if any criminal offence has taken place, he ought to 
be automatically charged with abetment. This is so 
because the definition of abetment includes acts as well 
as omissions. SIT has come to the conclusion that 47 
 
Accused Nos - 33 then Joint Commissioner of Police MK 
Tandon and then DCP Zone IV PB Gandia, were 
neg ligent in their duties: Having arrived at this 
conclusion, SIT had no option but to charge them with 
the criminal offence of abetment at least as the 
negligence did result in offences being committed or not 
being prevented.  
i) SIT should have held that the  statements and the 
documents which have been gathered make out a clear 
case of conspiracy against all including Accused No. 1.  
j) The Petitioner submits that as has been held by 
various courts a conspiracy is usually hatched in 
secrecy and very rarely the re is direct evidence of this. 
The offence can only be proved largely from inference 
drawn from acts or illegal omissions committed by the 
conspirators. Even at the time of trial, there need not be 
proof of express agreement. The agreement can be 
proved by  necessary implication. Besides, it is not 
necessary that all the conspirators  participate in all the 
offences resulting from  the conspiracy though they  
would be liable for each one of them.  
k) In the present case direct evidence exists in terms of 
Sanjiv Bhatt 's testimony about at least one part of the 
conspiracy being hatched at the meeting held on 
27.2.2002. Once this evidence is available it is for the 
trial court to decide what weight to attribute to it. It is 
not for the Investigating Agency to disse ct this evidence 
with a view to discredit the same.  
l) In any event, without prejudice to whether Mr. Modi 
made the statement attributed to him in the meeting on 
27.2.2002 the fact that the meeting took place is not 
disputed. One has to therefore to look a t the subsequent 
and prior events to decide as to what could have 
transpired at this meeting. It is obvious that as the 
event reflect a conspiracy was hatched at this meeting 
to allow the people to vent their anger (justified or 
otherwise, instigated or ot herwise, organized or 
otherwise) and not to intervene when offences are 
committed. In addition the forces were encouraged to 
abet this ire and to assist the people in venting it and at 
times to participate in it. Anyone who tried to maintain 48 
 
law and order was penalized. The conspiracy was very 
clear and played out over the next few days.  
m) The Petitioner further submits that the offences of 
conspiracy and abetment along with the responsibilities 
of public servants have, independently or together 
introduced  the concept of command responsibility 
under our criminal law. Therefore any public servant 
shall be criminally responsible for crimes committed by 
forces or officers under his or her effective authority and 
control, as  a result of his failure to exercise control 
(preventive or  punitive) over these crimes. This would 
include the Chief Minister/ Home Minister, other 
Ministers, police and bureaucratic top brass. This is 
more so since in the present case they knew or owing to 
the circumstances at the time, sho uld have known that 
the forces were committing or about to commit such 
crimes. It is further because the said public servants 
failed to take all necessary and reasonable steps to 
prevent or repress their commission or to submit the 
matter to the competent authority for investigation or 
prosecution.  
n) The Chief Minister/ Home Minister was directly in 
charge of law and order in the State. Under his aegis 
crimes were committed. No steps were taken to curb 
these crimes. Just to give an example, preventive 
arre sts were essential once the Bandh call was made. 
These are required for prevent commission of offence. 
No such arrests were made making the Home Minister 
downwards all responsible for crimes having been 
committed for failure to carry out preventive arrests . 
Besid es, if instructions were given to make preventive 
arrests and they were not carried out then failure to 
take steps against the officers for not having done 
preventive arrests itself will amount to failure to 
discharge duties as a public servant and abetment.  
o) SIT has misdirected itself in looking at the allegations 
and events in a piecemeal manner rather that a holistic 
manner. What was needed to be done was to look at 
events prior to 27.2.2002, on 27.2.2002 and 
subsequent to 27.2.2002 to see if a common thread 
emerges. If this was done an obvious and apparent link 
between all these events and conduct of the accused 
comes out which would be sufficient to charge them 49 
 
with conspiracy and abetment, apart from other 
offences.  
p) We further s ubmit that offences under S.153 A and 
B have been made out against accused who were 
charged with the same in our complaint and the SIT 
ought to have filed Charge Sheets in respect of the 
same.”  
(d) Besides the aforesaid points , in the course of arguments and 
in the written submissions, it has been urged as follows: - 
(1) It is urged that Article 21 of the Constitution not only 
guarantees protection of law  to all , but it also includes 
corresponding obligation on the State to fairly investigate the 
criminal cases  and prosecute the persons involved in 
commission of such crime as per the law.  The provisions in the 
form of the Code is the procedure established by law within the 
meaning of Article 21.  In the present case, the SIT failed to 
investigate into crucial m atters in the spirit of mandate of 
Section 156 of the Code and it is also failure of the Magistrate 
in exercise of powers to the fullest extent predicated in Section 
173 read with Section 190, in particular, sub -Section (1)(b) of 
the Code.  Even the High C ourt fell foul of the same error while 
dealing with the revision application of the appellant.  50 
 
(2) The complaint dated 8.6.2006 was only a piece of 
information.  The stand taken by the SIT that allegations 
beyond complaint cannot be looked at, is legally untenable .  If 
such a plea is countenanced, it would result in equating with, 
or limit the enquiry as in the case of scrutiny of a plaint in a 
civil suit, wherein the plaintiff is bound by the 
averments/contents of the complaint.  The order passed by this 
Court directing the SIT to “look into” the complaint, in no way 
constricted the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to direct scrutiny 
of allegations, which come to the fore, consequent to filing of 
protest petition.  
(3) The fact that appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri was relegated 
by this Court to file protest petition if the situation so 
warranted, was not to curtail the powers of the Magistrate 
including to direct further investigation.  In fact, the order of 
this Court ind icates that it was open to the Magistrate to 
exercise all powers vested in him for dealing with the issues 
that may arise upon presentation of final SIT report and protest 
petition by appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri . 51 
 
(4) It is significant to note that the co mplaint dated 8.6.2006 
referred to matters not limited to events unfolding in and 
around the Gulberg Society crime, but also about the series of 
activities and actions pointing towards the instructions being 
issued from the highest authority bordering on c onspiracy and 
abetment.  The order  of this Court  dated 7.2.2013 reinforces 
the stand taken by the appellant that the Magistrate had ample 
power to issue directions to SIT for further investigation into 
the relevant matters including referred to in the prot est 
petition.  Reliance was placed on Abhinandan Jha29 and 
Popular Muthiah vs. State represented by Inspector of 
Police30. 
(5) It is urged that it was the duty of the Magistrate to issue 
process and only after recording the evidence of the concerned 
witnesses, a conclusion could be reached about the 
truthfulness of the version and the piece of evidence in support 
 
29 supra at footnote No. 28 
30 (2006) 7 SCC 296 (paras 21 and 54)  52 
 
of the accusation .  Reliance was placed on State of Gujarat 
vs. Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta31. 
(6) According to the appellant, following issues have not been 
dealt with by the Magistrate and the Gujarat High Court :  
(i) Provocative behaviour was followed up by mass 
mobilisations and h ate speech on 27.2.2002 as part of 
the wider conspiracy.  As early as 12:30 p.m. on 
27.2.2002, a State Intelligence Bureau32 officer 
communicated to the headquarters that there were 
reports that some dead  bodies of Godhra victims would 
be brought to Kalupur Station in Ahmedabad and 
incidents will occur in Ahmedabad city and preventive 
action had to be taken. Home Department at 
Gandhinagar receive d more than eight  messages 
intimating about the Godhra incide nt, the VHP call for 
a bandh and about violence taking place in Valsad and 
other places.  
 
31 (2019) 20 SCC 539 (paras 16, 17, 22 and 39)  
32 for short, “SIB”  53 
 
(ii) Detailed documentary evidence from the SIT 
investigation papers pieced together meticulously in the 
protest petition reveals that SIB Messages had noted 
systematic and violent mobilisations all over the State 
on 27.2.2002 within minutes of the Godhra tragedy. 
Despite these warnings , neither the Home Department 
nor the law-and -order  machinery ma de preventive 
arres ts or protect ed innocent lives. Kar Sevaks with 
saffron scarves continue d shouting anti-Muslim 
slogans after incident; more VHP workers gather ed at 
spot and even after curfew had been declared at 10 a.m.   
Even after deployment of SRP and Railway police 
reinforcements , attempts to burn Muslim shops was 
taking  place at Godhra. Since the investigation of the 
Godhra incident was by the Railway Police, it was their 
responsibility to deal with dead bodies . 
(iii) By about 1 .00 p.m. in the afternoon violent and 
murderous attacks at Vadodara and Anand ha d taken 54 
 
place and by the evening the  same had  spread far and 
wide across the state.  
(iv) VHP Press Release carrie d exaggerated accounts of 
the Godhra incident. By the evening and late night of 
27.2.2002, SIB messag es from Godhra to Bhavnagar, 
Mehsana to Viramgam (far flung districts of Gujarat) 
record ed aggressive mobilization  and provocative 
speeches being made exhorting the mob/citizens to 
attack  Muslims.  
(v) An analysis of phone call records officially 
procured b y former IPS officer – Mr. Rahul Sharma and 
presented to the Nanavat i-Shah Commission , had been 
made and evidence of elected representatives talking to 
some of the offenders/ accused etc . was presented to the 
SIT.  The f ollowing aspects were not substantively 
investigated.  For example:  
(1) The mobile phone records show that        
Mr. Bhatt, named in the Zakia Jafri Complaint 
dated 8.6.2006, was in touch with doctors from 55 
 
outside the Godhra city, after which post 
mortems of the Godhra victims were carried out 
in the open in the Railway Yard . 
(2) The mobile phone records also ha d 
illustrative details of the phone call records of 
then Additional C ommissioner of Police - Mr. 
Shivanand Jha .  T hat ha s not been 
investigated . 
(3) Similarly, the mobile phone call records of 
Mr. Dinesh Togadia etc . of the VHP and other 
functionaries , had been mentioned but 
remain ed uninvestigated.  
(4) The mobile phone call records dated 
27.2.2002 of Dr. Praveen Togadia, International 
General Secretary, VHP , similarly remained to 
be investigated . 
(5) Ahmedabad city record ed 14 Incidents of 
targeted Violence even as the VHP and its 
members continue d making incendiary and 
inflammatory speeches.  
(6) The Gujarat Police Manual and Booklet to 
Prevent Communal Violence (specific to 
Gujarat) lay down meticulous SOPs (Standard 
Operating Procedures) - that were not  56 
 
followed at all in the wake of the Gujarat 
tragedy.  
(7) Despite the SIT papers containing 
documentary evidence of such more instances of 
attacks and aggression including hate speech, 
the SIT concealed these in its final report and 
deliberately avoided recording of any conclusion  
therein . 
(e) The SIT has clearly fai led to take into account the material 
appended to the complaint dated 8.6.2006 , such as report  titled 
“Crimes and Humanity ” published in 2002  by the Concerned 
Citizens Tribunal33, headed by former Judges of this Court and 
affidavits filed by the officials of the State before the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission.   The narrative discernible from this material has not 
been examined by the SIT in its proper perspective despite 
suggestive of strong case for investigation into a systemic and 
widespread conspira cy of subversion and inaction by law 
enforcement, bureaucracy and elected representatives entailing in 
systemic outbreak and spread of targeted violence across the State .  
 
33 for short, “CCT”  57 
 
Even the NHRC had to step in  to force the State to take corrective 
measures and ensu re justice to the riot victim survivors . 
(f) It was urged that the SIT was expected to follow the procedure 
prescribed by law while dealing with the materials/statements 
collated during investigation and more particularly, relied upon by 
the appellant.  As a matter of fact , the SIT failed to investigate into 
the crucial aspects referred to in the protest petition.  It is submitted 
that the rationale for protest petition has been expounded in 
Abhinandan Jha34 and Bhagwant Singh vs. Commissioner  of 
Police & Anr .35  It is not only  open to the informant to file protest 
petition, but also to any injured person  on all aspects concerning the 
complicity of concerned persons in the commission of alleged crime .  
That is what was perceived by this Court while disposing of the 
special leave petition filed by the appellant in the earlier round, vide 
judgment and order dated 12.9.201136.  The real intent and purpose 
of the direction issued by this Court in the earlier round has been 
 
34 supra at footnote No. 2 8 
35 supra at footnote No. 21 
36 supra at footnote No. 26 58 
 
whittled down by th e SIT, as well as, by the Courts  in not examining 
all aspects  raised by the appellant by way of protest petition.   
(g) In support of this grievance, emphasis is placed on the nature 
of enquiry done by the SIT in respect of Tehelka Sting Operation , 
and in not examining the crucial witnesses.  The contents of sting 
operation were clearly indicative of the genesis of communal 
violence , which  transformed lava erupting from  a volcano, destroying 
the fertile ground.   The SIT ha d glossed over crucial materials , such 
as statement  of Dhawal Jayanti lal Patel , the then VHP District 
Convener, Sabarkantha  and A nil Patel, VHP Vibhag Pramukh , 
Sabarkantha on the specious plea of the efficacy of the extra judicial 
confession of another pers on.  Reliance  is placed on the decision of 
this Court in  H.N. Rishbund & Anr. vs. State of Delhi37 and  Gura 
Singh vs. State of Rajasthan38. 
(h) The Courts (Magistrate/High Court) have failed to deal with the 
allegations pertaining to sting operation indicative of build -up before 
the incident and support of the high authority .  A llegations against 
 
37 AIR 1955 SC 196  = 1955 1 SCR 1150 (at pages 1155 -1157)  
38 (2001) 2 SCC 205  (para 6)  59 
 
Mr. Anil Patel were not investigated nor was he arrested, despite the 
extra judicial confession on record to indicate his complicity.  No 
question has been put to him regarding Tehelka Tape and its 
contents.   Similarly, the Magistrate has erred by going into the 
veracity/truthfulness or otherwise of the material on record.  That 
could be done only at the stage of trial.   The limited role of the 
Magistrat e at this stage is to prima facie  examine the material on 
record to find out the case of reasonable suspicion to take 
cognizance of the crime against the named offenders , as held in S.K. 
Sinha, Chief Enforcement Officer vs. Videocon International 
Ltd. & Or s.39.   
(i) It is further urged that in the interests of justice, as the detailed 
protest petition alongwith exhaustive  documentary evidence was 
presented, the Magistrate ought to have taken it as a complaint and 
directed further investigation in respect of issues raised therein.   In 
the protest petition, the complainant has dealt with whole series of 
events and supporting  documents and not a single or stray 
document from the investigation record , and relying on the totality 
 
39 (2008) 2 SCC 492 (para 22)  60 
 
of the circumstances, the allegation regarding larger criminal 
conspiracy has been set forth.  It is her case that the inciden t of 
violen ce across the State of Gujarat after Godhra incident on 
27.2.2002, w as encouraged and condoned and overtly supported by 
the State Government owing to their actions and omissions on the 
part of the State constituting criminal conspiracy.  The  actors in the 
said criminal conspiracy were broadly in four groups.  To wit, 
political establishment, bureaucrats, police officers and private 
organisations and individuals.  
(j) It has been further asserted that the Magistrate and the High 
Court have failed to deal with the following asp ects in the context of 
issues raised in the protest petition: - 
(i) The first component is about conspiracy in regard to the 
prelude and build -up before the Godhra incident on 27.2.2002.  
It has been mentioned in the protest petition that  the 
establishment  allowed generation of deepen ed feeling of hatred 
towards a particular community, as can be discerned from the 
SIB  record/ messages from at least 12.2.2002 onwards and also 
transcript of the Tehelka Sting Operation.  61 
 
(ii) The second is about the inaction of the  named 
offender /political/police/bureaucrat functionaries after  being 
intimated about Godhra incident, hate speeches and mob 
mobilizations  across the State on 27.2.2002.  
(iii) The third is about the inaction/non -response of all the  
authorities including police, fire brigade, other functionaries, 
by not promptly deploying Army , imposing curfew  and taking 
preventive measures and making prompt arrests of the culprits 
after outbreak of mass violence across the State post 
27.2.2002 . 
(k) The ingredients of the conspiracy  had been outlined in the 
complaint  dated 8.6.2006 and restated with further details and 
evidence in the protest petition in the shape of the actual official 
messages  indicative of systemic  build -up of communal tension 
before 27.2.2002.   The transcript of Tehelka Sting Operation 
reinforces the facts stated in the said messages.  Notably, the tapes 
of the sting operation have been authenticated by the CBI 
consequent to direction given by the NHRC and in fact, used by SIT 
in the cases investigated by them pursuant to the direction of this 62 
 
Cour t.  These crucial aspects are suggestive of larger criminal 
conspiracy .  However , the same  had been conveniently glossed over 
by the SIT.  
(l) To buttress the usefulness of Tehelka Sting Operation, the 
appellant  is relying on the transcripts of Mr. Anil Patel, VHP Vibhag 
Pramukh, Sabarkantha, Mr. Deepak Shah, member of BJP, 
Vadodara Unit, Mr. Haresh Bhatt, VHP and Bajrang Dal member, 
Mr. Rajendra Vyas, President, VHP, Ahmedabad City, Mr. Ramesh 
Dave, Kalupur Zila Mantri, VHP and Babu Bajrangi, a Bajrang Dal 
acti vist to urge that these were in the nature of extra judicial 
confessions and the persons should have been proceeded for 
appropriate offence in the context of their utterances and 
disclosures.  These transcripts were so revealing that no person with 
ordinar y prudence would disagree with the stand of the appellant 
that the same are replete with strong suspicion, warranting penal 
action.  The Magistrate, however, disregarded this sting operation by 
relying on the dictum of this Court in Piara Singh & Ors. vs. State 
of Punjab40.  Whereas the issue regarding admissibility of extra 
 
40 (1977) 4 SCC 452  63 
 
judicial confession is a triable issue and cannot be answered at this 
stage.   
(m)  As a matter of fact, Mr. Ashish Khaitan, the author/maker of 
the sting operation, had been examined as  prosecution witness by 
the SIT including in Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002.  
Even for this reason, it was not open to the SIT or the Courts to 
disregard the said material at this stage.  By disregarding such 
tangible and clinching material , the SIT had attempted to protect the 
named offenders .   
(n) It is further urged that the SIT has not even chosen to appeal 
against acquittals in Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 for 
reasons best known to them.  In substance, there was clear evidence 
rega rding conspiracy and corroborated by sting operation and the 
affidavit of Mr. R.B . Sreekumar , an IPS officer  [the then Additional  
Director General of Police (Intelligence)] , which have been 
conveniently discarded by the SIT and by the Courts.  
(o) The requisition of the NHRC order by the SIT  (directing CBI to 
authenticate Tehelka Sting Operation and the CBI’s detailed report 
on the same ), was followed by a submission of the entire  complete 64 
 
authenticated transcripts of the Tehelka Sting Operation by the 
appellant to the SIT investigating her  original complaint ( dated 
8.6.2006) vide letter dated 24.3.2010.  In that communication, the 
appellant also mentioned  in detail , various aspects of the matter  that 
need to be thoroughly investigated by the SIT, given the evidence in 
these extrajudicial confessions of a wider conspiracy and abetment 
to widespread targeted crimes.  The detailed letter by the appellant 
to the SIT indi cating the issues that need to be investigated , is a 
testimony of the fact that the investigating agency is being urged 
since 2010 to investigate the Sting Operation thoroughly. The 
complete transcripts , total 490 pages , had been provided to the SIT 
by the  appellant . 
(p) In the detailed authentication document of the CBI , the CBI 
officer authenticates the Sting Operation after forensic voice -tests 
were performed on those on whom the Sting Operation was 
conducted.  In the said Authentication Report, the CBI officer says:  
“13. On the basis of the above said enquiry, following  
conclusions can be drawn:  65 
 
i. The recordings in the 'Sting Operation' ar e found to be 
authentic as per Forensic Science Laboratory Report.  
ii. Most of the concerned persons appearing in the Sting 
Operation have admitted that they were contacted and 
that they have talked on the subject of Gujarat Riots, 
which has been recorded during the sting operations.  
14. The original statements and the laboratory report are 
enclosed herewith. The P.E. is being closed.  
15. Special Investigation Team (SIT), formed by Hon'ble 
Supreme Court to further investigate certain Gujarat riot cases, 
vide their letter dtd.03.02.2009 and reminder dtd. 28.04.2009 
have asked for equipment and recordings collected by the CBI. 
This is for information of NHRC and comments/ instructions, 
if any.  
16. This is for the information of NHRC and necessary act ion 
at their end please against High Court order .” 
(q) Meanwhile, the SIT appointed by this Hon’ble Court , whose 
mandate of investigation was extended , to also investigate the wider 
conspiracy into the violence that r ocked the State of Gujarat in 2002 , 66 
 
record ed the statement of Mr. Ashish Khaitan  on 27.8.2009 , the 
reporter who carried out the Sting Operation.   
(r) In a parallel development that further gives authenticity and 
legitimacy to the Sting Operation, Mr. Ashish Khaitan depose d as 
prosecution witness (PW -322) in the Naroda  Patiya case on 
19.12.2011.   On 29.8.2012, in its judgement convicting 31 persons 
of t he widespread massacre at Naroda  Patiya, the Special Sessions 
Judge made strong observations accepting the Sting Operation as 
corroborative evidence.  On the basis of this validation , two persons 
were convicted in this case.  
(s) Notably, the SIT appointed by this Hon’ble Court who 
investigat ed the Zakia Jafri complaint dated 8.6.2006 was/is also 
the prosecuting agency in the trials transferred to the SIT for further 
investigation including the Naroda  Patiya and Naroda  Gaam trial. It 
is, therefore , inexplicable and clear evidence of the compromised 
nature of the SIT investigation despite being  the agency entrusted 
with a sensitive task by this Court , who failed to thoroughly 
investigate the leads and implications laid out in the 67 
 
conversations/extra -judicial confessions revealed in Tehelka Sting 
Operation.  
(t) It has been urged that  relevant facts noticeable from the 
transcript of the Sting Operation  regarding manufacture of arms and 
bombs, bringing in the same from neighbouring States and other 
aspects o f wider conspiracy elucidated therein , have been completely  
ignored by the SIT and also by the Courts.   The transcripts also 
reveal the  involvement of senior officers of the Court, Advocates and 
public prosecutors, whose names are mentioned in the SIB 
mess ages in the build -up and communal mobilizations and  
reportedly involved in the intimidation and browbeating of senior 
serving officer (Mr. R.B. Sreekumar) prior to  his deposition before 
the Nanavati -Shah Commission.   It was, therefore, essential that the 
Magistrate should have directed further investigation into these 
aspects.  
(u) The original complaint  submitted by appellant -  Zakia Ahsan 
Jafri relies on slew of 23,000 pages of official record and non -official 
document s and records indicative of  inaction/failure of public 68 
 
servants and elected representatives  bordering on carefully woven 
conspiracy .   
(v) There was message indicating stockpiling of arms and also 
mob -gathering with impunity from the early morning of 28.2.2002  
when the dead bodies were brought to Sola Civil Hospital, 
Ahmedabad and breaking out of violence.  However, no police force 
was deputed.   Aftermath violence, there was no response from the 
fire brigade despite 45 distress calls being made by hapless  citizens , 
who were attacked by armed mob intending to kill and burn them.   
No arrests were made of the aggressors , much less preventive 
arrests.    
(w)  The loss of life  in such mass violence was mainly of persons 
belonging to minority community.   The unruly mo b was emboldened 
because of the Bandh call supported by the State .  The women and 
children were also not spared during such violence and the police 
remained a silent spectator .  
(x) After the outbreak of violence post -Godhra, SIB report (s) 
submitted by Mr. R.B . Sreekumar dated 24.2.2002, 15.6.2002, 
20.8.2002 and 28.8.2002 to the Home Department were deliberately 69 
 
ignored.  These reports had suggested strong corrective measures  
for restoration of normalcy.    
(y) Even the report submitted by Mr. E. Radhakrishnan, an IPS 
officer (the then Deputy IG ) to the Director General of Police , as late 
as August, 2002 , recommending remedial measures, was not acted 
upon  despite the spread of communal violence reported from 993 
villages and 151 towns covering 284 police stations (out of 464 police 
stations) spread over to 154 Assembly constituencies  out of 182 
Assembly constituencies.   
(z) The statements made by  Mr. Maniram, ADGP (Law and Order), 
Mr. P.C. Pande , the then Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad , Mr. 
K. Chakravarthi, Director General of Police, Gujarat and Mr. Ashok 
Narayan, Additional Chief Secretary (Home), reveal the  deliberate 
inaction and failure of the high officials and elected representatives.   
To aggravat e the situation, there was intentional delay in 
deployment of Army and declaring curfew at the earliest opportunity.  
(aa)  The SIT has also not enquired into the matters highlighted in 
the report of NHRC nor made any attempt to record any statement 
of officials or the Chairperson of the Commission.  The NHRC report 70 
 
refers to several aspects including experience of a sitting Judge of 
the High Court owing to the violent mob entering his premises.  The 
Statement of the Judge had not been recorded by the SIT.  
(bb)  The Cou rts have also failed to deal with the material regarding 
provocative behaviour followed by mass mobilizations and hate 
speeches post 27.2.2002 as part of the wider conspiracy.  The SIB 
officer  had communicated to the headquarters as early as 12:30 pm , 
on that day itself , that there were reports that some dead bodies of 
Godhra victims would be brought to Kalupur Railway Station, 
Ahmedabad, which may result in causing communal disturbance all 
across.  Despite such warning, neither the Home Department nor the 
law -and -order  machinery took preventive measures to protect the 
innocent lives and more so, even after growing violence  and 
murderous attacks at Vadodara and Anand happening by the 
evening and spreading across the State .  On the other hand, no 
action had been  taken against VHP office bearers  for issuing press 
release exaggerating the accounts of Godhra incident.  
(cc)  It was urged that the final ( closure ) report was erroneously 
tendered by the SIT before the Metropolitan Magistrate and not in 71 
 
the sessions trial concerning Gulberg Society case being CR No. 
67/2002 . 
(dd)  The SIT also failed to thoroughly investigate the messages of 
the SIB , which formed part of the affidavit of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar , 
and was made available to the SIT.   The contents of these messages 
support the allegation of build -up of a conspiracy even prior to 
27.2.2002 , in respect of which no corrective steps had been take n 
by the administration and persons in authority.  
(ee)  There was enough material with the SIT regarding the factum 
of hasty post -mortem s carried out on the dead bodies in open 
Railway yard under the directions from the highest authority, so as 
to ignite emotions giving fillip/ impetus to build up and cause 
communal disturbances and widespread violence.  Not only that, the 
charred bodies of dead persons were caused to be para ded and 
allowed to be taken by private person (VHP office bearer) in open 
vehicles from Godhra to Ahmedabad without observing essential 
protocols for the same purpose.   Relying on Rule 223 in the Gujarat 
Police Manual, it was urged that despite the prohibi tion, the 
photographs of mutilated bodies  were taken and no enquiry in that 72 
 
regard has been made.   None of the statements recorded by the SIT 
explain as to why such photographs were allowed.  
(ff)  There is contradiction in two different reports submitted by the 
SIT before this Court and support the allegation  of preparation for 
organising widespread violence after Godhra event.  
(gg)  The authorities produced the relevant contemporaneous 
official record after lapse of almost nine years, although it was very 
much available with the Government even earlier when it was 
required to produce  before the concerned forum.   That was not done 
on the specious plea  of non -availability of such a record.  
(hh)  No investigatio n has been done regarding the factum of 
intentional delay in imposing curfew and to bring in Army including 
for its immediate deployment by providing logistical assistance to 
control the overwhelming situation across the State of Gujarat, in 
particular, immediately after the carnage in the morning of 
27.2.2002 at Godhra.  
(ii) The SIT has not properly dealt with the role of Mr. M.K. Tandon 
and his acts of commissions and omissions warranting penal action.  73 
 
(jj) There was enough material to suggest that th e police 
administration was under complete control of political heavyweights 
and Ministers under instructions from the top  (Chief Minister) .  That 
was evident from the presence of the Ministers in the police Control 
Room and issuing directions to the local  police.  
(kk)  According to the appellant, the facts emerging from the 
materials referred to in the protest petition are so telling that no 
other inference except that the named persons had committed 
offence , can be drawn, particularly regarding larger conspiracy.  In 
that, no preventive measures were taken either before the episode of 
Godhra on 27.2.2002, or even thereafter, despite the seriousness 
and sensitivity of the situation.  No preventive arrests were made 
and if at  all done in two cases, it was against the persons belonging 
to minority community.  Further, when the violence erupted across 
the State, no effort to douse the emotions of the violent mob was 
seen to be taken by the persons in authority, both by political  
dispensation and bureaucracy and police.  The persons indulging in 
the gruesome activity were not arrested, much less stopped from 
doing so.  Further more , when it came to investigation, ‘A’ Summary 74 
 
Report (s) came to be filed in most of the cases, which wa s a clear 
reflection on the failure of police  administration , investigating such 
horrendous  crime.   Intriguingly, the persons who were arrested by 
the local police, were released on bail or interim bail obviously 
because of the (intentional) lackadaisical approach of the public 
prosecutor (s).  Not only  that, the investigating machinery opted to 
accept  the version of th e offender as a gospel truth  and doubted the 
statements of the victims of crime.   The malice not only pervaded in 
the local police, but also in the manner of investigation by the Court 
appointed SIT .  No investigation whatsoever has been done regarding 
pre-Godhra incident conspiracy, carrying funeral procession on the 
basis of instructions to officials and handing over dead bodies for 
that purpose to private person s (Hasmukh Patel , Secretary of the 
Eastern Wing of VHP, Ahmedabad  and Jaideep Patel , Gujarat 
Secretary of VHP , Naroda Gao /Gaam , Ahmedabad ) including issuing 
instructions from the top (Chief Minister) to all the officials to give 
free hand to the mob.  Even post  Godhra incident , conspiracy be fore 
the unfolding of the violence across the State on 28.2.2002 has not 
been taken note of nor any FIR registered in that behalf, much less 75 
 
any investigation done by local police or for that matter, Court 
appointed SIT.  
(ll) The SIT, as well as, the Courts hav e dealt with statements of 
the concerned persons recorded by the SIT as gospel truth and have 
arrived at conclusion on that basis.  This, amongst others, is a 
manifest error committed in dealing with the issues on hand.  The 
Magistrate while dealing with t he protest petition and the final report 
ought to have applied the scale of strong suspicion emanating from 
the materials collected by the SIT.  And that was enough to proceed 
against the perpetrators.  From the undisputed document (s), even a 
layman would be able to decipher that a case of strong suspicion 
about the involvement of the named persons in the commission of 
offence has been clearly made  out.  Reliance is placed on State of 
Bihar vs. Ramesh Singh41 and State  (Delhi Admn.) vs. I.K. 
Nangia & Anr.42 to urge that if suspicion can be deduced from the 
record, that would be enough for Magistrate to take cognizance.  It 
is further urged that even if it is not a case of strong suspicion , the 
Magistrate was obliged to direct the SIT to do further investigation 
 
41 (1977) 4 SCC 39  
42 (1980) 1 SCC 258 (para 6)  76 
 
on relevant a spects/allegations including in respect of matters 
outside the complaint , but specifically noted in the protest petition .  
It was the bounden duty of the Magistrate to so direct, and also 
primary responsibility of the SIT to investigate every piece of 
info rmation which had come to the fore by way of complaint or the 
protest petition.  
(mm)  It is submitted that the larger conspiracy material was not 
investigated in Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 and for 
that reason, it was essential to investigate every  aspect regarding 
larger conspiracy.  
(nn)  It is submitted that the stand taken by the SIT on the basis of 
material collated during investigation, in no way indicate d that mass 
violence had triggered till 1.00 p.m . on 28.2.2002 .  This stand is in 
conflict with the fact of sending requisition to call for Army at about 
2.30 p.m. on 28.2.2002.  This is a clear reflection on the approach 
of the SIT  to obfuscate the enquiry.  
(oo)  The approach of the SIT to record the statements of persons  
named as offenders and to accept explanation given by them to form 
its opinion thereby exculpate those persons  is ex-facie  fallacious.  77 
 
For, the explanation offered by the offenders would be a matter of 
their defence  in the trial .  The material indicating  their complicity 
cannot be disregarded and veracity thereof could be tested only 
during the trial.  Notably, not even a single statement of victim has 
been recorded by the SIT.  
(pp)  As a matter of fact, neither the local police nor the SIT has 
undertaken the t ask as is exposited by the expression 
“investigation”, as defined in Section 2(h) of the Code.  The 
expression “investigation”  also means finding out footprint of the 
statement/allegation, which is to undertake the meaningful 
investigation in respect of every singular aspect.  The SIT  has not 
maintained the purity in investigation and failed to investigate 
crucial aspects warranting further investigation.  
(qq)  The officers, who collaborated in the conspiracy, were 
eventually rehabilitated to high po sitions and those who did not do 
so, were persecuted by the concerned administration.  
(rr)  There was glaring evidence regarding the fact that even fire 
brigade facility was consciously denied to the persons belonging to 
the minority community.  The frantic phon e calls made by them were 78 
 
not even attended to, despite the emergent situation faced by them.   
The SIT made no effort to enquire into this factual allegation and did 
not call for explanation of concerned officials of fire brigade . 
(ss)  There was no adequate pol ice bandobast  laid in anticipation 
nor stern measures taken when the actual violence t ook place on 
28.2.200 2 across the State.  This was not a mere case of laxity or 
failure of the police administration, but a concerted effort under 
instructions  from the top , when in fact, the ir public duty was to 
protect the life and property of everyone.  The situation was 
aggravated because of the State support to the bandh call given by 
the agitators.  The SIT made no attempt to investigate these 
allegations forthcoming from the record before it.   There was material 
to indicate that the official record had been destroyed under 
suspicious circumstances.  
(tt)  Reliance has been placed on Firozuddin Basheeruddin & 
Ors. vs. State of Kerala43, Nirmal Singh Kahlon vs. State of 
Punjab & Ors.44, R. Venkatkrishnan vs. Central Bureau of 
 
43 (2001) 7 SCC 596 (paras 20, 23 and 25)  
44 (2009) 1 SCC 441 (para s 67 and 68 ) 79 
 
Investigation45 and  State (NCT Delhi) vs. Shiv  Charan Bansal & 
Ors.46. 
(uu)  The SIT has not enquired into the false propaganda for inciting 
violence and the publication in that behalf, despite the SIT having 
received said documents.  
(vv)  Reliance is placed on State of Karnataka & Anr. vs. Dr. 
Praveen Bhai Thogadia47 and  Amish Devgan vs. Union of India 
& Ors.48 to contend that incitement to violence is punishable 
offence.  
(ww)  The SIT has not enquired into the evidence regarding hate 
speech.  Regarding hate materials, the material on record was 
glaring.  That included false reporting by regional media outlets like 
Sandesh on 28.2.2002, claiming 10 -15 Hindu women being dragged 
away from the Railway compartment (at Godhra) by fanatic mob.  
The Gujarat police had denied any such incident having been taken 
place.  However, no action has been taken against the publisher or 
 
45 (2009) 11 SCC 737  
46 (2020) 2 SCC 290  
47 (2004) 4 SCC 684 (paras 7 and 8)  
48 (2021) 1 SCC 1 (paras 20, 37, 75, 87, 88, 103 and 107)  80 
 
the reporter.  The same newspaper had reported on 1.3.2002 on the 
front page with prominent heading that dead bodies of the 
kidnapped young women from Sabarmati Express have been 
recovered with their breasts chopped off and that Gujarat is aflame 
because of Muslim fundamentalists.  These canards have been 
tolerated b y the concerned administration unabated, thereby 
fuelling the emotions and hatred between the two communities.  This 
was despite the reporting by the SIB headed by Mr. R.B. Sreekumar 
recommending prosecution for provocative lines by the VHP in 
publication and anonymous pamphlets.  Even the then ACS (Home) 
– Mr. Ashok Narayan had admitted in his statement to the SIT that 
this matter had been brought to the notice of the State Government, 
but no action was ever taken.  Similarly, the then Commissioner of 
Poli ce, Vadodara – Mr. D.D. Tuteja had recommended action against 
Sandesh newspaper in 2002, so also, Mr. Rahul Sharma, an IPS 
officer and the then (in 2002) S.P., Bhavnagar sought permission to 
register a criminal case against Sandesh newspaper.  Even the SIB  
through Mr. P.B. Upadhyaya, the then DCP (Intelligence) had sought 
sanction for prosecution of Sandesh newspaper, as recommended by 
Mr. Rahul Sharma.  There is also material to indicate that CCT  had 81 
 
highlighted the pretentious writing and propaganda disse minated by 
VHP and also widely reported in “The Express” on 24th March, 
allegedly circulated by the Bajrang Dal President – Hastimal, who is 
said to have been arrested.  The theme of such publication was: 
“Don’t purchase anything from Muslim shops, don’t t ravel in their 
vehicles or visit their garages; don’t watch films which feature 
Muslim stars.  In this way, we can break their financial backbone”.  
According to the appellant, the SIT has chosen to turn a complete 
blind eye to this official documentary ma terial and other material on 
record, despite the fact that publication of such material constitutes 
offence in law, warranting investigation and appropriate action.  This 
coupled with the sting operation, clearly establishes the existence of 
a larger consp iracy.  
(xx)  The Courts have failed to analyse the opinion of the SIT 
founded on the undisputed material indicative of prelude and build -
up before 27.2.2002  in the form of  hate speeches and mobilisation 
all over Gujarat on 27.2.2002, the inaction of 
political/po lice/bureaucrat functionaries despite the serious 
episode of Godhra in the morning of 27.2.2002 and also their 82 
 
inaction after outbreak of violence on 28.2.2002, not taking 
preventive measures, deploying the adequate police force, no prompt 
arrests, no curf ew declared and delay in calling the Army.  The 
conspiracy was at different levels and at different timelines having 
causal connection with the violence across the State on and from 
28.2.2002, in particular.  
(yy)  According to the appellant, hate speeches all ac ross were part 
and parcel of incitement to targeted violence and a systemic 
conspiracy.   The authorities allowed  hate speeches  unchecked and 
unprosecuted to promote hatred amongst the two communities.   
Moreover, in furtherance of a pre -hatched conspiracy, large body of 
armed and aggressive groups of people took to the street  for taking 
revenge owing to tragic killings at Godhra.  The hate speeches were 
in the form of statements of prominent political leaders before and 
after 27.2.2002, regional (vernacular)  media/press published in 
Gujarat and pamphlets with incendiary content by right wing 
organisations across the State.  No preventive action nor any arrest 
or prosecution was deliberately effected , despite such concerted 
effort .  The Courts have not adverted to this grievance of the 83 
 
appellant at all.   The  SIT investigated issue of hate speech as an 
independent head  concerning the speeches of the former Chief 
Minister of Gujarat and has glossed over plethora of hate writings 
and speeches of prominent p ersonalities, especially those belonging 
to the VHP.  The SIT  has failed to reckon the issues noted in the 
protest petition concerning hate speeches /writings and more 
particularly, the failure of the State Government to take prompt 
action in that regard.  
(zz)  It is urged that the SIT has not named any person referred to 
in the complaint dated 8.6.2006 and the protest petition except  
Babu Bajrangi, who has been prosecuted in Naroda Patia 
(Ahmedabad City) carnage case.  None of the other persons have 
been named in  any of the hate speech cases investigated by the SIT.  
The SIT could not have accepted the version of the persons 
disregarding overwhelming material indicative of their complicity.  In 
such a case, it would be a triable issue.  
(aaa)  The appellant in fact rel ies on SIT record in support of the 
prayer for further investigation, at least in respect of the following 
matters : - 84 
 
(i) Failure of administration, touching upon collaboration 
and conspiracy . 
(ii) The State administration indulged in destroying the 
critical record.  
(iii)  Handing over bodies to Hasmukh Patel and Jaideep Patel.  
(iv)  Post -mortems carried out in open at Railway yard.  
(v) Parading of bodies/Funeral procession and mob attacks.  
(vi)  Delayed imposition of curfew and calling Army.  
(vii)  Bandh call officially supported.  
(viii)  Partisan public prosecutor.  
(ix)  NHRC case and related cases related to Gujarat Carnage, 
2002.  
(x) Subversion of the Criminal Justice System that included 
(a) Manipulation of Investigation from the start: doctoring 
of FIRs, ensuring powerful offenders were not named, the 
narrative was manipulated and twisted to show the victim 
minority community as aggressor and perpetrator;  
(b) ensuring easy bail for those among the perpetrators 
who were arrested; and  85 
 
(c) appointing Public Prosecutors who had a dual identity 
i.e., those who were pro -active members of organisations 
like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and 
Rashtriya  Sway amsevak  Sangh (RSS).  
(bbb)  The SIT, for reasons best known to it, followed irregular 
procedure of taking initials of the persons whose statements were 
being recorded despite a bar under Section 162 of the Code.  The SIT 
made no attempt to seize the mobile and ob tain call records of the 
relevant party.   Moreover, no public notice was issued by the SIT 
after the complaint dated 8.6.2006 was made over to it by this Court 
in terms of order dated 27.4.200949.  If such public notice was to be 
issued, as was done after taking over investigation of nine cases 
pursuant to order dated 26.3.200850, many of the family members 
of the victims or the victims themselves would have come forward 
and handed over more mater ial to the SIT  concerning the allegation 
of larger conspiracy.  
 
49 supra at footnote  No s. 4 and 1 7 
50 supra at footnote No s. 6 and 1 6 86 
 
(ccc)  The SIT chose to rely on the extracts in the report of the State 
appointed Commission (Nanavati -Shah Commission), despite the 
clear legal mandate that the same cannot be used as evidence in civ il 
and criminal action, as expounded in Shri Ram Krishna Dalmia 
vs. Shri Justice S.R. Tendolkar & Ors.51 and Kehar Singh & 
Ors. vs. State (Delhi Administration)52.  At the same time, relying 
on the decision of the Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at 
Madras in Abdul Sathar vs. The Principal Secretary to 
Government53, it is urged that the State Government is expected to 
act upon the recommendations made by the  NHRC unless for non -
acceptance it provides reasons .  The NHRC in  its report  in the 
present case, made certain recommendations.  Further, t here was 
tangible material in the form of report of the Committee on 
Empowerment of Women54, report of constitutional authority, such 
as the Election Commission of India confirming the allegations made 
in the protest petition, which have not been investigated at all.  
 
51 1959 SCR 279 (para 9)  
52 (1988) 3 SCC 609 (paras 36 to 41)  
53 W.P. No. 41791/2006 (with connected cases) decided on 5.2.2021  
54 Ninth Report of the Committee on Empowerment of Women (2002 -2003)  concerning violence against women 
during riots (July -August 2002)  87 
 
(ddd)  Reliance is placed on  Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh & Anr. vs. 
State of Gujarat & Ors.55, Zahi ra Habibulla Sheikh (5) & Anr. 
vs. State of Gujarat & Ors.56 and  Dayal Singh & Ors. vs. State 
of Uttaranchal57.   
(eee)  Further, t he SIT has not enquired into the evidence in the form  
of statement of Mr. Dileep Trivedi, Public Prosecutor regarding 
instructions issued for providing  Advocate to accused  belonging to a 
particular community, indicative of the bias in favour of that 
community and being party to the conspiracy.   
(fff)  The Standard  Operating Procedure  given in the Gujarat Police 
Manual , such as Rules 45, 46 and 53  therein , has not been followed 
in its letter and spirit.  
(ggg)  The statement of Mrs. Jayanti S. Ravi , District Magistrate, 
Godhra  is not consistent with the official record, which was certainly 
a matter creating suspicion about the correctness of the statement 
so made.  
 
55 (2004) 4 SCC 158 (paras 2, 5, 7, 10, 18, 30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 39, 40, 52, 60, 61, 68, 71 and 75)  
56 (2006) 3 SCC 374 (paras 4, 5 and 9)  
57 (2012) 8 SCC 263 (paras 1, 21, 22, 25 to 28, 32 and 47.5)  88 
 
(hhh)  The SIT had failed to seize the mobile phone of Mr. 
Hasmukh Patel and Mr. Jaideep Patel , which could have unravelle d 
the truth about their  involvement.  Mr. Jaideep Patel is the same 
person who had made revelation  to the Press on the same day  i.e., 
27.2.2002.  
(iii)  The telephonic call records  produced by Mr. Rahul Sharma  
have also not been investigated.  The statement of Rahul Sharma 
dated 2.7.2009 to SIT was clinching to establish the plea regarding 
call records, which SIT discarded  on the specious ground that the  
same was produced for the first time in 2008.  The Additional 
Commissioner of Police , Crime  Branch , Ahmedabad – A.K. Surolia, 
has also stated in his statement before the SIT that it was he who 
had instructed ACP, Crime Branch – S.S. Chudasama  to extract the 
relevan t call details from the relevant cellular service providers  – 
M/s. AT&T and M/s. Cell force.  This has not been investigated  by 
the SIT.  The call records given to Mr. P.C. Pande , the then 
Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad  have also not been analysed.   
The call records would show that Mr. Haresh Bhat t was in constant 
touch  with the doctors from outside the Godhra city , after which post 89 
 
mortems of the Godhra victims were carried out in open in the 
Railway yard.   The call records also indicated that Mr. Sh ivanand 
Jha , the then Additional Commissioner of Police, Sector 1,  
Ahmedabad City  was part of the larger conspiracy , which is  clear 
from his 68 phone calls made on 27.2.2002  either owned by 
politicians or officials (unofficially)  and 192 calls on 28.2.2002  
including to then Power Minister , State of Gujarat  – Mr. Kaushik 
Jamnadas Patel (an MLA elected from his area) and another elected 
representative – Dr. Maya Kod nani, who has been named as accused 
in another case and convicted  by the trial Court .  The call records 
also pertain to Mr. Dinesh Togadia and Dr. Praveen Togadia, officer 
bearers of VHP.  All these call records have remained uninvestigated.  
(jjj)  No explanation is forthcoming from the SIT as to why call 
record was not procur ed between 2008 and  2010.  This is significant 
as the SIT was directed to “look into” the complaint dated 8.6.2006 
vide order dated 27.4.200958 and the SIT had submitted its final 
report to this Court in September, 2011.  
 
58 supra at footnote No s. 4 and 1 7 90 
 
(kkk)  The SIT  had made no effort to enquire into the fact that 
following the Godhra incident the massacre followed in Deepda 
Darwaza, which case was also assigned to SIT by this Court.  Even 
that incident was a part of larger conspiracy , which has remained to 
be dealt with in the concerned trial in right perspective.  
(lll)  The SIT could have also taken notice of Private Citizen s 
Commission headed by former Supreme Court Judges regarding 
human rights violation and the contents of the said report  indicative 
of high officials of the State being party to conspiracy in commission 
of crime.  
(mmm)  It is urged that need to direct further investigation can be 
substantiated on the basis of undisputed facts emerging from the 
materials/statements collated by the SIT.  
(nnn)  In cases of allegation regarding larger conspiracy, there 
could be no direct evidence.  That is a matter to be investigated and 
inferred on the basis of the material pointing out towards such 
circumstances.  Reliance is placed on Nazir Khan & Ors. vs.  State 91 
 
of Delhi59.  There is no investigation whatsoever regarding existence 
of conspiracy despite the same being revealed from Tehelka Tape 
itself.   Reliance is  also  placed on Firozuddin Basheeruddin60 and 
Nirmal Singh Kahlon61 to contend that even the second FIR is 
permissible if the evidence regarding conspiracy surfaces  after 
registration of the first FIR.   Further, acceptance of final report 
submitted by the investigating officer is no impediment for enquiring 
into fresh mat erial brought to the notice of the investigating officer 
or the Court, if warrants taking cognizance.  
(ooo)  The SIT  has not offered any remark regarding the statement of 
Mr. Bharat Bhatt , Special Public Prosecutor  and Mr. Deepak Shah, 
who were questioned by the SIT for reasons best known to it.  
(ppp)  It is urged that appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri had appeared as 
prosecution witness (PW -337)  in Gulberg Society case being CR No. 
67/2002  and not as a complainant.   Whereas, in the present action, 
appellan t – Zakia Ahsan Jafri was p rosecuting the matter as 
complainant.  
 
59 (2003) 8 SCC 461 (paras 16 to 22)  
60 supra at footnote No. 43 
61 supra at Footnote No. 4 4  92 
 
(qqq)  The appellant ha s also explained  as to how the error has been 
committed in mentioning the name of Mr. Rahul Sharma and Satish 
Verma as offender Nos. 45  and 63 respectively , though they were 
cited as witness es in support of the allegations made in the 
complaint and protest petition.  That was also explained to the SIT 
at the earliest opportunity.  
(rrr)  It is urged that undue reference was made about the adverse 
observations recorded agains t Ms. Teesta Setalvad by the Court .  
That was wholly  inappropriate .  For, the  stated adverse remarks 
came to be expunged by this Court  in Testa Setalvad & Anr. vs. 
State of Gujarat & Ors.62.  Reliance was placed on some 
proceedings for similar purpose against Mr. R.B. Sreekumar .  Those 
proceedings are still pending  and will be of no avail  to SIT .  One of 
the reasons weighed with the SIT to discard the statement of  Mr.  
R.B.  Sreekumar was , therefore, untenabl e on the face of it because 
the correspondence pertain s to period much before Mr. R.B. 
Sreekumar had raised issues regarding violation of his service 
conditions with  the department.  
 
62 (2004) 10 SCC 88 (paras 4 and 7)  93 
 
(sss)  The SIT had filed material alongwith final report consisting of  
(i) documentary evidence (officially received), (ii)  documentary 
evidence otherwise collected by the S IT, (iii) video -audio recordings 
of a sting operation authenticated at the instance of the NHRC by 
the CBI and relied upon by the SIT in various prosecutions, (iv) extra 
judicial confessions evidenced by the sting operation and (v) witness 
statements in respect of individuals in relation to the events that 
took place prior to February 27, 2002 until order of this Court dated 
12.9.201163.  The Magistrate was obli ged to examine the voluminous 
documentary and other evidence to ascertain whether some matters 
raise strong suspicion of offences having been committed , being 
sufficient reason to issue direction to the SIT to further investigate 
the same , even if it was not a case of taking cognizance straightaway .  
Reliance is placed on Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta64 and S.K. 
Sinh a65. 
(ttt)  The appellant w as relying on undispute d documents available 
in the SIT record, which alone were sufficient to issue summons for 
 
63 supra at footnote No. 2 6 
64 supra at footnote No. 31 
65 supra at footnote No.  39 94 
 
alleged offences, as it clearly indicate d the complicity of the persons 
named in the complaint/protest petition and in any case, raise d 
strong suspicion about the commission of such offence .  The reports 
of Mr.  R.B. Sreekumar to the Government between April and August, 
2022, constitute official d ocumentary evidence, which the SIT has 
disregarded.  That being the substantive evidence, was required to 
be reckoned by the SIT.  
(uuu)  The Courts cannot adopt the approach of forgive and 
forget, but it is the solemn duty of this Court to ensure that all guilty 
are brought to book and prosecuted in accordance with law.   He 
would submit that: - 
“The Republic is like a shop… that ship has to be made steady.  
It is your task to keep the Republic steady .  It would be steady 
only if majesty of law prevails.  This is a  case where the 
majesty of law has been deeply injured…  Despite actionable 
evidence the court has chosen not to look at it and misread 
the order of SC.  In this case violence has been perpetrated 
through design which is reflected in the documents…  I leav e 
it then to your lordship to decide. ” 
(vvv)  It is submitted that it would be a different matter if the Court 
feels that the material on record did not raise any suspicion.  
(www)  In the backdrop of the stand taken before us in respect of 
allegation Nos. (i) and (iv) articulated in the final report dated 95 
 
8.2.2012 , at the time of conclusion of the hearing, we requested the 
learned senior counsel for the appellant to submit written statement 
in that regard, which he submitted after the case was adjourned for 
pronouncement of verdict, in the following words: - 
“STATEMENT OF THE PETITIONER QUA LARGER 
CONSPIRACY  
The Petitioner has made her submissions based on 
undisputed  evidence in the form  of Tehelka tapes and 
official communications of public functionaries. The 
Petitioner  has not sought to allege any  wrongdoing, 
criminal or otherwise, with reference to  facts that are 
disputed. The Petitioner contends that a larger conspiracy 
involving  individuals whose undisputed extra -judicial 
confessions are on tape, read along with  inactions of 
officials demonstrated by undisputed documents, should 
have been  investigated by the SIT, which could have 
established a larger conspiracy. The  submission is that the 
SIT did not investigate th e larger conspiracy, but limited 
itself  to matters in dispute relating to a meeting of 
February 27, 2002. Qua that meeting,  the SIT has come to 
a certain conclusion which is part of the closure report. 
Since  the Petitioner has not made any submissions on 
disputed facts, the Petitioner did not  contend before 
this Hon’ble Court that a larger conspiracy emanated 
from the  meeting of February 27, 2002 . In fact, during 
the course of submissions, no  reference was made by the 
Petitioner to this meeting at all.  The undisputed evidence 
on record points to a larger conspiracy which appears 
to have involved bureaucrats, politicians, public 
prosecutors, VHP, RSS, Bajrang Dal  and members of 
the State political establishment. It is this conspiracy 
that is not  investigated by the SIT . The extent of the 
conspiracy, the identity and number of  individuals 
involved, the preparatory acts committed and the time, 
place and manner  in which the meeting of minds for 
purposes of such conspiracy took place can only  fully 
emerge on inves tigation and is not something that the 
Petitioner can be called  upon to provide answers to. ” 
(emphasis supplied)

SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT – SIT  
7. (a) The thrust of the argument of the respondent -SIT, is that , 
after direction s given by this Court vide order dated 27.4.200966 to 
“look into”  the written complaint  of appellant , it immediately moved 
into action and did everything that it could do to investigate every 
singular allegation noted in the complaint.  The SIT could cull  out 
thirty  broad allegations in the complaint made over to it for 
investigation.  In addition to those thirty  allegations, the SIT also 
investigated into two additional allegations including the 
comments/observations of the Amicus Curiae  in reference to the 
final report presented to this Court , and recorded its opinion in that 
regard in the final report submitted to the Magistrate.  The SIT left 
no stone un turned and thoroughly investigated all aspects of the 
matter67, as also, exhaustively analysed every piece of 
information/material collected by it during the investigation by 
 
66 supra at footnote No s. 4 and 1 7 
67 including by recording statements of 66 witnesses during preliminary enquiry between 19 June, 2009 – 18 
December, 2009, 120 witnesses  during preliminary enquiry between 12 January, 2010 – 23 December, 2010 , 76 
witnesses during further investigation betwee n 14th August, 2010 – 10th November, 2010  and 145 witnesses during 
further investigation 23rd November, 2010 till 13th January, 2012  97 
 
recording statements of 375 persons and questioning 275 persons  
in terms of the d irection given by this Court . 
(b) The final report besides dealing with each of these 32  (thirty -
two ) allegations exhaustively , has also separately dealt with the case 
against each of the 63 persons named as offenders in the complaint 
dated 8.6.2006.  As aforesaid, the final report submitted to the 
Magistrate also reproduces the observations of the Amicus Curiae  
and deal s with every aspect thereof to form its opinion that no 
offence is made out , much less  having been committed by the 
offenders named in the complaint.  It is urged that t he investigating 
agency is entitled to form its opinion dependent on the legally 
admissi ble evidence/material collated during investigation .  
Further, the SIT had to investigate within the remit  given to it by this 
Court.  In that, vide order dated 27.4.200968, this Court directed the 
SIT appointed by it to only “look into” the complaint date d 8.6.2006 
of appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri .  No direction was given to the SIT 
to register it as FIR.  Notably, this Court consciously adopted such 
a course - despite the main prayer of appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri 
 
68 supra at footnote No s. 4 and 1 7 98 
 
to register her complaint as FIR and to  get the same investigated 
through an independent agency.  Not only that, upon submission of 
the final report by the SIT , the appeal filed by the appellant [SLP(Crl.) 
No. 1088/2008 ] was disposed of and the SIT was directed to submit 
appropriate report before the Magistrate taking cognizance in the 
Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 .  This is  despite the fact 
that the trial of the said case had progressed before the Sessions 
Court after filing of the last supplementary chargesheet on 
12.8.2009.   The trial of the said case , thus, continued under the 
directions of this Court including  dated  6.5.2010.  In that sen se, this 
Court adopted a sui generis  procedure which was not in strict 
consonance with the procedure  predicated  under the Code .  
Resultantly, the S IT was bound to strictly follow the directions of this 
Court in every aspect  without exception.  And that, the SIT ha d fairly 
discharged its role to the satisfaction of this Court, as noticed from 
the order s dated 1.5.20 0969, 12.9.201170 and as recently as, 
13.4.2017.  
 
69 supra at footnote No. 1 8 
70 supra at footnote No. 26 99 
 
(c) In the writ petition filed before the High Court, relief claimed 
was not for assigning investigation of complaint dated 8.6.2006 to 
the SIT (appointed by this Court in connection with nine  major cases 
which included Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/200 2), but to 
an independent investigation agency.  That prayer , obviously , stood 
rejected by the High Court  and  even by this Court consequent to 
direction issued on 27.4.200971 in the special leave petition filed by 
the appellant, directing the SIT to only have a look at the complaint.  
(d) It is urged that this Court even vide order dated 12.9.201172, 
did not direct registration of the complaint dated 8.6.2006 as FIR .  It 
only called upon the SIT to take necessary follow -up steps.  The 
complaint dated 8.6.2006, in one sense, was regarded by the SIT as 
further information in relation to the Gulberg Society case being CR 
No. 67/2002, investigation and trial whereof was allow ed to proceed 
by this Court at the same time.  The last supplementary chargesheet 
in that case came to be filed as back as on 12.8.2009.  
 
71 supra at footnote No s. 4 and 1 7 
72 supra at footnote No. 2 6 100  
 
(e) The remit of the SIT , in terms of the directions issued by this 
Court from time to time was only to examine whether the material 
referred to in the complaint disclose s commission of any offence of 
larger conspiracy at the highest level and involvement of any person 
other than the accused persons named in CR No. 67/2002 
concerning Gulberg Society.  That being the remit of t he SIT, it could 
not have investigated into any other aspect without an express 
direction of this Court.  This is also for the reason that the allegation 
of conspiracy at the local level had already been investigated into in 
all other cases registered at the relevant time, around 2000 in 
number, including the nine major cases assigned to the Supreme 
Court appointed SIT.  The allegations which are made in the 
complaint are based essentially on the record/affidavits of the 
officials of the State, filed before  the Nanavati -Shah Commission.  
(f) Additionally, the direction given by this Court on 12.9.201173 
in the special leave petition filed by the appellant , would not only 
bind the SIT  and  the Magistrate dealing with the final report, but 
also the appellant herein .  No liberty was sought or had been given 
 
73 supra at footnote No. 2 6 101  
 
by this Court to the appellant to make fresh allegations beyond the 
allegations noted in the complaint dated 8.6.2006  and already 
investigated by the SIT in terms of order dated 12. 8.2009.  As a 
matter of fact, appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri being the complainant 
could have availed of the remedy under Section 190 of the Code by 
presenting a complaint before the competent Magistrate , as observed 
by the High Court vide order dated 2.11.2007.  She  did not avail of 
that remedy.  Instead, the appellant  approached this Court by way 
of SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008 and submitted to and acquiesced of the 
directions issued by this Court from time t o time.    
(g) Significantly, in proceedings before this Court, Ms. Teesta  
Setalvad had assisted the Amicus Curiae  appointed by this Court 
and presumably also for articulating the observations in the note 
submitted by him  to this Court and to which the S IT had duly 
responded and dealt with in the final report presented before the 
Metropolitan Magistrate , in terms of this Court’s order dated 
12.9.201174.  Even the Magistrate was bound by the remit applicable 
to the SIT in view of the sui generis  procedure adopted by this Court 
 
74 supra at footnote No. 2 6 102  
 
in treating the report of the SIT as further report under Section 
173(8) of the Code (in the Gulberg Society case being CR No. 
67/2002 ) to be presented before the Magistrate alongwith the 
statements recorded by the SIT , treating them as statements under 
Section 161 of the code in terms of order dated 7.2.2013.  
(h) It is urged that the appellant ha s repeatedly changed the 
goalpost with a view to create confusion.  Amongst others, the 
manner in which her complaint dated 8.6.2006 ought to proceed, 
despite the crystal -clear  order of this Court .  Further, for the first 
time, it is now urged  that the same  (complaint dated 8.6.2006) ought 
to be treated as a private complaint and proceeded with by the 
Magistrate under Section 190 of the Code.  
(i) It is urged that t he argument of the appellant to treat the 
protest petition as a private complaint, is one of desperation and in 
any case, untenable in light of the express direction given by this 
Court to the SIT to submit its report to the Magistrate taking 
cognizance of CR No. 67/2002 being the Gulberg Society case - as 
further report under Section 173(8) of th e Code.  If the report was to 
disclose commission of such offence of larger conspiracy or 103  
 
abetment, as the case may be, the Court could have proceeded 
against the concerned persons and tried in sessions trial arising 
from CR No. 67/2002 by framing requisit e charge(s) in that regard.  
The refore,  the complaint could neither be registered as FIR nor could 
be treated as a private complaint in the wake of sui generis  direction 
given by this Court vide order dated 12.9.201175 in the special leave 
petition preferr ed by the appellant.   Reliance has been placed on 
Vishnu Kumar Tiwari76 
(j) It is urged that when the SIT called upon appellant – Zakia 
Ahsan Jafri to give her statement in connection with the complaint, 
she declined to do so and it has been so recorded in the  opening part 
of the final report as well.  She wanted the SIT to treat her complaint 
as FIR and register the same.  Accepting this request would have 
been contrary to the spirit of the direction given by this Court (vide 
order dated 27.4.200977) to SIT, t o only look into the complaint and 
to take further steps in that regard.  Until the special leave petition 
filed by appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri was disposed by this Court on 
 
75 supra at footnote No. 2 6 
76 supra at footnote No. 2 7 (paras 7, 17, 27, 32, 33 and 42)  
77 supra at footnote No s. 4 and 1 7 104  
 
12.9.201178, no request was made to this Court to clarify the 
position or for issuing directions to register her complaint as 
FIR /complaint . 
(k) Although in the rejoinder argument , the learned counsel for the 
appellant had stated that he had never argued for treating the 
complaint/protest petition of appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri as 
com plaint under Section 190 of the Code , it is noticed that a clear 
stand has been taken in paragraph 5 of the written note  being 
Convenience Compilation (Volume I) filed by the appellant in this 
regard.   Further, in the protest petition, fresh allegations  have been 
made , which in any case cannot be linked to the allegation of larger 
conspiracy  required to be investigated by the SIT in terms of 
successive orders passed by this Court.   The attempt of the 
complainant was obviously to  make wild and preposterous 
allegations and keep the pot boiling in the name of taking action 
against new offenders referred to in the protest petition while  not 
pursuing allegation Nos. (i) and (iv) which had been thoroughly 
investigated  by the SIT and found to be devoid of substance .  A 
 
78 supra at footnote No. 2 6 105  
 
deceptive  stand is taken that the appellant would like to pursue the 
matter only o n the basis of undisputed material/ documents  - having 
realised that the basis on which allegation Nos. (i) and (iv) came to 
be made, was a figment of imagination  of the persons attributing 
certain utterances to the then Chief Minister  to make  it sensationa l 
news .  Significantly, SIT was entrusted with investigation of other 
crimes, which it completed to the satisfaction of this Court.  In those 
cases, not even a tittle of remark has been made by the trial Court 
to trace it to the allegation of  larger conspiracy .  However , the 
appellant ha s highlighted unconnected matters (Deepda Darwaza 
case and Sardarpura case) , in the guise of protest petition  filed in 
Gulberg Society case.  
(l) Whereas, it had been understood by all concerned that the SIT 
was expected to investigate into the allegation regarding “larger 
conspiracy ” to cause and precipitate mass violence across the State 
and not the criminal conspiracy at the local level resulting in violence 
at Gulbe rg Society , in respect of which CR No. 67/2002  had already 
been registered.  In that, as regards the conspiracy to commit offence 
mentioned in CR No. 67/2002 , that had already been investigated 106  
 
and chargesheet filed , including supplementary chargesheet s from 
time to time.  It is not in dispute that even the trial Court, which 
dealt with the said crime , had formulated the very first  point  for its 
determination on the basis of charges  framed against the accused 
named in the said trial being CR No. 67/2002  - regarding pre -
planned conspiracy to form an unlawful assembly  and thereafter 
perpetrate the carnage at Gulberg Society on 28.2.2002, which 
resulted in death of 69 persons  and  attempts  to murder, caus ing 
grave and serious injuries to residents of Gulberg Society and also 
caus ing damage and destruction of vehicles  and property there at.   
(m)  Similarly, the allegation regarding events of mass violence 
spread across the State being State -sponsored crime had been made 
even in Bilkis Bano  case and Best Bakery  case and other cases 
including eight other cases investigated by the SIT.  Those 
allegations have been dealt with in the concerned cases.  In other 
words, the complaint dated 8.6.2006  submitted by appellant – Zakia 
Ahsan Jafri  was to be looked into by the SIT in respect of allegation 
regarding larger conspiracy  at the highest level alone  and not the 
conspiracy at the local (lower) level.  107  
 
(n) The appellant  is now heavily relying on the following: - 
(i) Tehelka tapes which surfaced in 2007;  
(ii) The CDRs;  
(iii)  The SIB messages;  
(iv)  The call for Gujarat Bandh;  
(v) The “hate material”;  
(vi)  The handing over of dead bodies;  
(vii)  Post mortem at the Railway station in open yard;  
(viii)  Presence of Ministers in the Control Room and DGP office;  
(ix)  Response of the fire brigade;  
(x) PCR messages by Mr. Pande;  
(xi)  Delay in curfew;  
(xii)  Delay in requisition of Army;  and  
(xiii)  Partisan/prosecutors . 
However, e ach of these issues  were considered at great length by this 
Court between 2008 and 2011 whilst monitoring the investigation 
done by the SIT  and culmin ating in final report.   The findings of the 
SIT had also to pass through the strict scrutiny of the Amicus Curiae 
assisting this Court, who was authorised to even interact with the 
witnesses  examined/questioned by the SIT.   It would be, therefore, 
travesty of justice and doubting the  wisdom of this Court which had  108  
 
supervised/monitored the investigation completed by the SIT  on all 
aspects  and being satisfied permitted the SIT to present the final 
report before the Magistrate .  The entirety of the material was 
presented before this Court by the SIT from time to time.   The final 
report in question presented before the Magistrate, therefore, 
forecloses the enquiry concerning the allegations in complaint dated 
8.6.2006.  
(o) According to the SIT, considering its remit , the Magistrate was 
also  required to examine the final report  on that basis and to satisfy 
about the plausibility of the conclusions drawn by the SIT on the 
materials collected by it.   The Magistrate entered upon such exercise  
and applied his mind to the totality of the circumstances including 
by taking note of the issues raised in the protest petition  and 
accepted the final report  being convinced that no case was made out 
for issuance of process against the named offenders or any other 
person.  
(p) As regards larger conspiracy, the allegation is mainly founded 
on the aff idavits/materials filed by the official s and others before the 
Nanavati -Shah Commission appointed by the State of Gujarat  under 109  
 
the 1952 Act .  The Commission, however, has dealt with  every aspect 
of the affidavit (s) filed by the concerned officials before it  including 
the material which also forms part of the complaint submitted by 
appellant  – Zakia Ahsan Jafri .  The opinion of the Commission in 
that regard is no different than the  conclusions reached by the SIT.  
Notably, the Commission submitted its report after the SIT had 
already filed its final report before the Magistrate .   
(q) Indeed , the opinion of the SIT must conform to the material 
dealt with by it in its report .  In the present case, the final report of 
the S IT is  exhaustive and deals with every singular aspect necessary 
to answer the allegations made in the complaint  - which is on the 
basis of analysis by the SIT by reckoning the material collected 
during the investigation.   The analysis of the entire material by the 
SIT is not only allegation -wise, but  named offender -wise  including 
witness -wise and objection/noting (wise) of the Amicus Curiae  in 
response to the previous further report  of the SIT submitted before 
this Court .   
(r) The SIT has thoroughly analysed the allegations against each 
offender  in the subject final report on the basis of material collected 110  
 
by it , as can be discerned from pages 363 -364, 367, 370 -385, 388 -
392 and 395 -397 .  Only after such thorough analysis, the SIT ha d 
opined that  no offence has been made out nor the stated offender  
can be said to be involved in the commission of offence of larger 
conspiracy.  
(s) The complaint highlights the pattern of continual concerted 
lack adaisical  approach of high officials of the State Government , who 
were allegedly acting under dictation from the highest authority of 
the elected political dispensation.  The theory of larger conspiracy is 
put forth mainly  on the basis of alleged utterances of the then Chief 
Minister in the meeting held soon after the ghastly incident of train 
burning in Godhra on 27.2.2002  and the subsequent official meeting 
on 28.2.2002  including before the Press.  The case made out in the 
complaint dated 8.6.2006 is that the high officials followed the 
directions given by the then Chief Minister and issued instructions 
to their subordinates to justify pre -orchestrated mass carnage that 
enjoyed the political sanction of the constitutionally elected 
Government in Gujarat.  Hence, i t was nothing short of State 
sponsored violence against a particular community . 111  
 
(t) The remit of the SIT was, therefore, to investigate the 
allegations in the complaint , which it had done meticulously , as can 
be discerned from the final report submitted by it running into about 
231 closely typed pages (in the paper  book of this Court, mentioned 
as pages 1 to 270 on the cover page of the report filed) , analysing 
ever y piece of material/evidence collated by it allegation -wise, 
offender -wise, as well as the observations of the Amicus Curiae  on 
the final report presented by the SIT before this Court.  The final 
report is the compendium of the previous reports submitted before 
this Court and the clarification of the SIT in respect of observations 
of Amicus Curiae , point -wise.  The permission gi ven by this Court in 
terms of order dated 12.9.201179 is a seal of approval of this Court 
about its satisfaction regarding  the completion of  fair  investigation 
done by the SIT  in respect of allegations contained in complaint 
dated 8.6.2006.  If there was even a little doubt, this Court , as in the 
past , would have certainly directed the SIT to do further 
investigation in respect of left out matters.   As noted earlier, Ms. 
Teesta  Setalvad had interacted with the Amicus Curiae  before he had 
 
79 supra at footnote No. 2 6 112  
 
submitted his observations by way of a note to this Court and made 
over to the SIT.   As all concerned had acted upon and accepted the 
sui generis  pro cedure followed by this Court in dealing with  the 
complaint dated 8.6.2006 including regarding its investigation and 
directing presentation of an appropriate report before the Magistrate 
taking cognizance of CR No. 67/2002 concerning the Gulberg 
Society in terms of order dated 12.9.201180, neither the SIT nor the 
Magistrate could travel beyond the said remit.  For the same reason, 
it would not be open to the complainant/informant/appellant to 
make fresh allegations, much less not connected with the larger 
conspiracy  at the highest level , already investigated by the SIT under 
the supervision of this Court.  
(u) In any case, the emphasis placed by the appellant on matters 
referred to in the protest petition are in respect of unconnected 
events and not having direct  or causal  bearing on the allegat ion of 
larger conspiracy, particular ly involving the political dispensation, 
as well as, the high officials, bureaucrats and police functionaries 
allegedly acting under the dictation of the then Chief Minister.  
 
80 supra at footnote No. 2 6 113  
 
Notably, no submission  has been advanced  on the meeting held on 
27.2.2002 under the chairmanship of the then Chief Minister or 
about the testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, IPS, the then 
Superintendent of Police (Security), who falsely claims to have 
attended the official meeting.  
(v) As regards allegations regarding Ministers found sitting in the 
Police Control Room and giving instructions to the officials, the SIT 
has thoroughly examined the said allegation and after due enquiry, 
was of the opinion that the Ministers even though visit ed the Control 
Room, were to ascertain the developments and not for giving 
instructions, as is the routine practice.  No material has come on 
record to indicate that the Ministers ha d given specific direction one 
way or the other to the subordinate officia ls, which may be regarded 
as a case of larger conspiracy.  Absent such evidence, mere fact that 
the Ministers had visited the Police Control Room would not take the 
matter any further, much less to charge the offenders named in the 
complaint with any offen ce. 
(w)  As regards the  allegation  that the State did not stop the State 
wide Bandh call, it does not follow that the officials and elected 114  
 
Government had entered into larger conspiracy culminating with the 
events unfolded on 27.2.2002 onwards.  In the first pl ace, the 
materials collated during investigation does not corroborate this 
fact.  In any case, t he inaction or for that matter, tacit support of the 
elected Government of the State to the State wide Bandh , by itself 
absent any other incriminating circumsta nce /material , cannot be 
the basis to initiate prosecution against the high officials of the State 
on the charge of  criminal  conspiracy and for violence happening 
across the State.  
(x) As regards the allegation regarding late deployment of Army, 
the same was fo und to be devoid of substance by the SIT.  The 
material collected during  investigation reveal ed that the then Chief 
Minister, on the basis of inputs and sensing serious problem across 
the State, had telephonically interacted with the then Home Minister 
of the Government of India at 1.00 p.m. for deployment of Army  and 
a formal written request was se nt on fax to the Union Ministry at 
2.30 p.m. on 28.2.2002.  The arrival of army took some time due to 
unavoidable situation and after providing logistical assistance, the 
Army was deployed  immediately on the following day .  These 115  
 
measures taken by the Stat e Government , in fact , are  indicative of 
prompt steps taken to avoid any further untoward situation  and 
destroys the theory of larger conspiracy by the State at the highest 
level or State supported violence.  
(y) It was urged by the respondents that material on  record taken 
into account by the SIT has been noted even by the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission and the trial Court in Gulberg Society case being CR 
No. 67/2002, indicative of the measures taken by the State in 
anticipation of the riots, but the civil administra tion was overrun 
across the State.  Further, apprehending the fallout aftermath the 
Godhra train burning episode and the general unrest all around, 
Army was requisitioned on 28.2.2002 itself even before the violence 
had actually taken serious proportion  across the State.  The Army 
arrived on the same midnight, as they were posted at the borders 
due to security reasons aftermath the attack on the Parliament on 
13.12.2001  (which had happened only two months earlier) .  After 
arrival and providing logistical support at the local level, the Army 
was deployed in sensitive areas across the State.  The 
contemporaneous record would, therefore, indicate that the theory 116  
 
of larger c onspiracy propounded in the complaint is falsified being 
imaginative.  
(z) As regards the partisan investigation in the concerned criminal 
cases, the same was also of no avail, as there was no evidence 
forthcoming to connect it with the allegation of larger con spiracy.  
(aa)  The SIT had examined everyone involved including the then 
Chief Minister until the last Minister and found that there was no 
material to connect them with the allegation of larger conspiracy.  
(bb)  It is submitted that allegation  concerning the conduct of 
grassroot level officers had nothing to do with the allegations 
regarding larger conspiracy  at the highest level.  
(cc)  Even allegations based on the affidavit of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar 
had nothing to do with the allegations  of larger conspiracy  and in 
particular , the directions issued from the highest  authority  – the 
then Chief Minister .  Furnishing of alleged misleading reports by the 
State Home Department to the central Election Commission for 
conduct of early elections, also has no connection with the theory of 
larger conspiracy  being the cause of eruption of violence across the 117  
 
State .  It is pointed out that appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri, in her 
evidence recorded on 22.10.2010, accepted that  Mr. R.B. Sreekumar 
was at the relevant time, working with an NGO and Ms. Teesta 
Setalvad was associated with that organisation.  Interestingly, s he 
was none else, but the convener  of the Private Citizens Commission  
headed by former Supreme Court Judges and was in a position to 
influence appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri.  It is submitted that Ms. 
Teesta Setalvad, for reasons best known to her and out of vengeance, 
was interested in continuing with  her  tirade and persecution on the 
basis of unsubstantiated allegations in the complaint in the name of 
quest for justice with real purpose to keep the pot boiling and 
sensationalise and politicize the cri me.   The version of Mr. R.B. 
Sreekumar in the later affidavits commenting about the functioning 
of the administration, must be viewed in the context of his denial of 
career opportunities . 
(dd)  Indisputably, Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, former IPS officer was 
posted as A dditional Director General of Police , Armed Unit, Gujarat , 
at the time of riots , who had filed nine affidavits before the Nanavati -
Shah Commission .  He did not derive any of its contents from 118  
 
personal knowledge/information, which he might ha ve received as 
occupant of the stated office.   Further, he did not make any 
allegation against the State Government in his initial two affidavits 
filed before the Commission, but started making allegations from 
third affidavit dated 9.4.2005, presumably beca use he was deprived 
of service benefits having been superseded by his junior – Mr. K.R. 
Kaushik.   Later , he got involved as an accused  in the FIR filed by 
CBI in ISRO spying  case, which ha d been registered under directions 
of this Court in S. Nambi  Narayanan vs. Siby Mathews  & Ors.81 
and again  between the same parties82. 
(ee)  Appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri in her cross -examination in 
Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 as PW -337 had 
conceded that she knew Ms. Teesta Setalvad for some time and also 
about having met Mr. R.B. Sreekumar after the incident.  She has 
stated that  Mr. R.B. Sreekumar had come to Gulberg Society on 
28.2.2002 and upon completion of four years she had met him.  She 
had also stated that Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was presently working with 
Ms. Teesta Setalvad.  She had also admitted in her cross -
 
81 (2018) 10 SCC 804  
82 2021 SCC Online SC 760  119  
 
examination tha t she had given statement on 22.8.2003 before the 
Nanavati -Shah Commission and after giving that statement, she had 
no occasion to read copy of that statement.  This was suggestive of 
the fact that she was tutored by Ms. Teesta Setalvad, but she never 
disc losed about that, which fact she had to admit in the cross -
examination.  She had also admitted in her cross -examination that 
Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was disappointed with the Government.  At the 
same time, she was unable to recall about the enquiry made by the 
SIT in connection with the affidavit filed by her before the 
Commission.  And that, she had throughout followed the 
instructions of Ms. Teesta Setalvad.  In the final supplementary 
report filed by the SIT in Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002, 
it has been clearly noted that nineteen witnesses insisted to take on 
record their prepared signed statement(s), which according to them, 
wer e prepared by Ms. Teesta Setalvad and Advocate – Mr. M.M. 
Tirmizi and did not show willingness to give their own statement.   
The statements so presented were stereotyped copies/computerised 
prepared statements given to them by Ms. Teesta Setalvad and 
Advoc ate – Mr. M.M. Tirmizi and they had merely signed such 
prepared statements.  120  
 
(ff)  The final report extensively discusses the allegations culled out 
from separate affidavits filed by Mr. R.B. Sreekumar before the 
Nanavati -Shah Commission  after recording the state ments of 
concerned persons and collecting relevant documents  - as can be 
discerned from pages 264 -266, 271 -283, 285 -287, 297 -298 , 302 -
312, 326  and 329 . 
(gg)  The other allegations founded on the version of Mr. Rahul 
Sharma were also enquired into and the SIT examined the relevant 
call records to conclude that the same were baseless.  The 
allegations were broadly regarding laxity and failure in maintaining 
law a nd order during the relevant time . 
(hh)  The SIT recorded statements of all the relevant persons who 
were stung in the Tehelka Sting Operation.  The call details of Babu 
Bajrangi , who was one amongst them, clearly establishes that he 
was in Ahmedabad from mornin g 11:15 hrs. on 27.2.2002 and, 
therefore, he could not have been in Godhra at the time of Godhra 
train incident.  Similarly, the call details of Haresh Bha tt were 
analysed, which revealed that he was present in Ahmedabad till 9:30 
hrs. on 27.2.2002.  His l ocation was again shown in Ahmedabad  121  
 
directly at 18:40:21 hrs., which support s his claim that he had gone 
to his village during the interregnum  period , when connectivity was 
not there .  Again on 28.2.2002, his location remained at tower of 
mobile service provider in Paldi in Ahmedabad  till 12:00:04 hrs. on 
that day .  This supported his claim that he had visited his village for 
a week.  In any case, Haresh Bha tt had not been named in the FIR 
register pertaining to riot cases in Gujarat or in the com plaint filed 
by appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri.  
(ii) As regards the  argument founded on Tehelka Sting Operation  
about build -up of arms and ammunition in Gujarat even before 
Godhra train incident, the contents of the transcript are not 
corroborated from the mater ial available with the SIT.  The trial 
Court in Sessions Case No. 152/2002 arising from Meghaninagar PS 
FIR No. 67/2002  (Gulberg Society case) regarding use of firearms in 
the incident, had observed in paragraph 722 that there is no 
evidence or recovery of  the bullet fired from private weapon  by any 
member of the mob.   The only case is that the material recovered  
from the scene of offence  were empty cartridge shells and bullet 
casings, ballistically  established to have been fired from the licensed 122  
 
weapon to be of the ownership of late Mr. Ehsan Jafri.  In other 
words, there is no corroborative material forthcoming regarding 
commission of any offence  by the offenders named in the complaint, 
much less of larger conspiracy.  
(jj) The  Tehelka Sting Operation in a way relates to the allegation 
regarding criminal conspiracy at the local level.   The contents thereof 
have nothing to do with the allegation of larger conspiracy enquired 
into by the SIT as directed by  this Court.   The local level conspiracy 
had been investigated in the respective cases including the nine 
cases  investigated by the SIT under supervision of this Court.  In the 
concerned cases, all persons involved including  the persons 
recorded in the sti ng operation  have been proceeded against in the 
concerned case.  As  had been pointed out, SIT nevertheless recorded 
statements of 13 persons out of 18  involved  in the operation ‘Kalank ’ 
by Tehelka .  The statements of those persons in law could be used 
against the maker of the statement as extra judicial confession, but 
not against  others  and more so without corroborative piece of 
evidence.   The SIT  had not only recorded the statement of Babu 
Bajran gi, but also Prakash S. Ratho d (a worker at a Petrol pump) 123  
 
and Haresh Bhat t.  Their presence at the place referred to by them 
stood falsified by the call detail records.  Their version has been 
analysed by the SIT and found to be unuseful in the context of the 
allegation of larger conspiracy being enquired by it under directions 
of this Court.   Until the disposal of the matter by this Court on  
12.9.201183, the issue s now raised were never  pointed out even by 
the Amicus Curiae . 
(kk)  The learned counsel would also urge  that incorrect statement 
was made on behalf of the appellant that the SIT had not recorded 
statement of any victim .  This submission  is falsified from the record 
of the SIT, which includes  the statements  of concerned victims  
(minority community) , list whereof has been mentioned  in paragraph 
35 of the Final Note Part -III with heading “Clarification as to 
Conspiracy in the Gulberg Case”.    
(ll) Similarly , incorrect allegation was made against the SIT about 
the records produced by Mr. P.C. Pand e.  Those records were 
produced by Mr. Pande on his own and not as per directions given 
by this Court.  Furth er, the record was a scanned copy of the PCR  
 
83 supra at footnote No. 2 6 124  
 
messages done by him and in his custody.  Whereas, the original 
records  which were allegedly scanned by him, were destroyed in the 
year in 2008 itself as per rules in Gujarat Police Manual.   As such, 
the SIT cannot be blamed for non -recovery of the original PCR 
message record .   
(mm)  It was also faintly suggested that the SIT  had failed to 
record further statements or re -examine the witnesses.  It is urged 
that those persons who came to give thei r statements to SIT, their 
statements were recorded by the SIT without exception.   If any 
witness wanted to give further statement, could have done so on his 
own if he desired to share further information.  But no such request 
was received by the SIT.  If the SIT wanted to re -examine any 
witness , it could have done so unhesitatingly .  In substance, the 
allegation about the inaction of the SIT or partisan attitude  during 
the investigation is , to say the least , preposterous.  
(nn)  It is urged that the SIB messages being exchanged between the 
concerned officials itself is indicative of the fact that the State 
Government and the police were proactive in dealing with the crisis 
that was evolving post -Godhra episode.   Additionally, on 28.2.2002 125  
 
itself, the State called for Army assistance by sending a formal 
request in that behalf and on arrival of Army after giving logistical 
assistance, it was deployed  all across the sensitive areas in the State .  
This also is indic ative of the fact that proactive measures were being 
taken by the State, but that was overrun by the expanse  of 
spontaneous mass violence.   The SIT had noted that the SIB being 
responsible to collect intelligence regarding law -and -order  situation 
in the St ate, was at the relevant time headed by  Mr. G.C. Raiger, the 
then Additional Director General of Police -Intelligence .  The 
authorities who were supervising the functions of this department 
have been named as being part of pre -planned larger conspiracy.  
However, on analysing the messages, it is noticed that the 
intelligence agencies of the State were collecting the relevant 
intelligence and disseminating the same to the concerned 
authorities.   Thus understood, the allegation of pre -planned larger 
conspiracy  and involvement of named high officials remained 
unsubstantiated  and not even warranting any suspicion about their 
involvement.  126  
 
(oo)  It is urged that left to the appellant , she had gone to the extent 
of suggesting that the two train bogies  were put on fire as a part of 
pre-planned conspiracy hatched by the highest authority .  This is 
only figment of imagination , preposterous and in disregard of the 
hard facts discernible from the  material collected by the SIT 
including in the investigation concerning Godhra incident clearly 
spelling out the manner in which that incident had occurred.   The 
trial of that case has established the involvement of accused who 
had been convicted for bein g responsible for the said incident  and 
appeal therefrom is pending in this Court.  
(pp)  It is urged that assuming that it is a case of intelligence failure 
and in a given situation , inaction of the concerned authority 
responsible to take corrective measures, such failure  cannot take 
the colour of being involved in criminal conspiracy as such.   For 
being involved in the crime of criminal conspiracy, there ought to be 
positive material indicative of deliberate act of commission and 
omission and meeting of minds of the concerned person s, which was 
completely absent and not forthcoming during the investigation  
conducted by the SIT to enquire into the allegations of larger 127  
 
criminal conspiracy.   The SIT had investigated into the role of every 
person named as offender in the complaint under consideration  and 
analysed the same in the final report offen der-wise as well.  
(qq)  The SIT  had recorded statements of various offici als of SIB, 
such as Mr. P.B. Upadhyay, the then DCI (Communal ), Mr. O.P. 
Mathur, the then IGP (Admn. & Security), SIB , Mr. G.C. Raiger, the 
then Additional DG (Intelligenc) , as also of Mr. Ashok Narayan, ACS 
(Home) , which ha ve been taken into account for forming opinion , as 
noted in the final report.   Despite  the efforts put in by the officials, 
there are situations which are unpredictable being sporadic, 
sudden , spontaneous  and dynamic in nature.   Even with best of 
anticipation and arrangements in place, it would get overwhelmed 
by the proportion of violence all across the State .  In such 
eventuality, it would be a case of collapse of State administration , 
but cannot pass th e muster of concerned officials being part of larger 
conspiracy.   The officials are expected to respond to the evolving 
situation while adhering to the norms , but may end up  in a situation 
which can go beyond their control at various place s across the State  
owing to mass violence.  128  
 
(rr)  The SIT had also closely examined the allegation of conspiracy 
in making kerosene bombs and came to the conclusion that there 
was no evidence worthy of proceeding against the named offenders, 
much less on the alleg ation of larger conspiracy for want of evidence 
regarding meeting of minds in particular.  
(ss)  In reference to the argument that the trials against the named 
accused were being compromised by the public prosecutor (Mr. 
Arvind Pandya), has also been rebutted by the SIT on the argument 
that the public prosecutor to whom reference has been made by the 
appellant, was not appointed by the State in any single criminal case 
investigated by the SIT, but had appeared before the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission.  Further, he had resigned in 2008 before the SIT took 
over the investigation of the complaint dated 8.6.2006.  He could not 
have, in any way, influenced the trial in any of the specified cases.  
Out of nine  cases, trial in eight cases had been completed under the 
gaze of S IT and in none of the cases, any adverse opinion has been 
recorded by the concerned Court  in that regard .  Thus, th e plea in 
support of the allegation of larger conspiracy is tenuous.  129  
 
(tt)  As regards allegation No. (xv) , it is submitted that public 
prosecutor appointed by the State Government before the Nanavati -
Shah Commission had not been named in the complaint, but now 
during the arguments, his role in compromising the trials was being 
highlighted.  This cannot be cou ntenanced.  
(uu)  Significantly, the contents of the complaint dated 8.6.2006, 
besides relying on the materials/affidavits filed before the Nanavati -
Shah Commission, also note that there are some matters which 
could not have been considered by Nanavati -Shah Commi ssion and 
reference is made to such matters.  Even that aspect has been duly 
investigated and the opinion formed by the SIT was that the same 
are unconnected with the allegations of larger conspiracy.  
(vv)  Noticeably, the final report dated 8.2.2012 was present ed by 
the SIT before the Metropolitan Magistrate pursuant to the direction 
given by this Court on 12.9.201184 even before the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission had submitted its report, which was tabled in the 
Assembly on 18.2.201 2.  Furthermore, the allegation reg arding 
larger conspiracy of State -sponsored violence noted in the 
 
84 supra at footnote No. 2 6 130  
 
complaint, was required to be investigated only in the last case 
investigated by the SIT i.e., Gulberg Society case being CR No. 
67/2002.  Not even a remote reference was made to such allega tion 
in the other eight  cases investigated by the SIT.  Similarly, no 
allegation about unfair investigation done has been made against 
the SIT in any of those cases including before this Court, except in 
the present case.  
(ww)  It is urged that since the appellant  has  now chosen not to 
pursue allegation Nos. (i) and (iv), the entire basis of the complaint 
dated 8.6.2006 has become irrelevant and redundant.  For, stated 
allegation s were essentially about the larger conspiracy involving 
highest political aut hority/ bureaucracy  and actions or inactions  of 
the high officials unfolding under dictation of the then Chief 
Minister.  The remaining allegations would then be unconnected 
with the larger  conspiracy and, therefore, need not be taken forward 
against the th en Chief Minister and high officials of the State 
Government.  In any case, every allegation has been duly enquired 
into and investigated by the SIT before forming its opinion that no 131  
 
case had been made out against the offenders named in the stated 
complai nt. 
(xx)  The appellant, however , has now changed the goalpost  by 
placing emphasis on transcripts of Tehelka Tape on the argument 
that genuineness of the tape ha d not been doubted ; and , therefore, 
to contend that the contents of the tape inspire confidence to proceed 
against the persons named in the complaint.   On the other hand, 
even though the Tehelka tape did not form  part of the complaint 
dated 8.6.2006, which was filed almost four years after the events of 
February, 2002 as the Tehelka tape s urfaced only on 27.10.2007 , 
yet the SIT enquired into the same in the context of the persons 
named in the complaint as offenders.  For, in law, it could be used 
as extra judicial confession only against the maker of the statement 
and not against other pers ons though referred to in such a 
statement85.  In that light, the Tehelka tapes, heavily relied upon by 
the appellant , were of no avail.  Notably, the tapes have been relied 
in three other cases investigated by the SIT and also in Gulberg 
Society case being CR No. 67/2002 , but the trial Court has adversely 
 
85 R.K. Anand vs. Registrar, Delhi High Cour t, (2009) 8 SCC 106 and  Rajat Prasad vs. C entral Bureau of 
Investigation , (2014) 6 SCC 495  132  
 
commented upon the said tape, which decision is now subject matter  
of appeal before the High Court  and this Court in those cases . 
(yy)  Further, e ven if the material in Tehelka sting operation being a 
genuine work is to be accepted, it does not follow that the contents 
of such tape would have probative value.  Upon investigati on, if it 
was to be found that the tape and the contents have probative value, 
only then it could be used , that too against the maker of the 
statement alone and not against any other person.  
(zz)  It was pointed out that Mr. Ashish Khaitan was examined as 
PW-313  in trial of Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 and 
his version has been duly dealt with in the said judgment by the 
Trial Court, for not accepting the contents thereof.  
(aaa)  It is urged that the complainant has been continuously 
introducing new arguments/allegations at different stages of the 
proceedings.  That has been depicted in the chart given in paragraph 
45 of the Final Note Part -III of respondent No. 2, which reads thus : 
-

 Issues related to the

of Lt. Gen. 
Zameeruddin 
Shah, who led the 
army operation in 
Gujarat during the 
riots .  His 
statements were 
never recorded by 
SIT.  The book 
stated that the 
soldiers were 
stranded at the 
airfield when the 
riots started.  
2. Allegation of 
post -mortem of 
the dead bodies 
at Godhra 
Railway Station  A-1 on the 
afternoon of 
27.2.2002 
instead of going 
directly to

 Petitioner witnessed police 
officers in the barracks on 
leave while Ahmedabad 
burned.  SIT “collaborated 
with accused 
persons and 
rewarded 
handsomely”.  Role 
of SIT should be 
investigated.  
3. Tehelka Sting

time of riots and 
their successors  The Motor 
Cavalcade 
carry ing 54 dead 
bodies covered 
distance of 153 
kms from Godhra 
to Sola Civil 
Hospital in six 
hours.  It can be 
inferred that the 
cavalcade was 
stopping on the 
way and 
instigating 
violence.  Preventing the imposition 
of curfew.  Argument of the 
petitioner at 
prev ious stages 
was that the larger 
conspiracy was 
hatched by named 
accused persons, 
and manifested 
mainly through 
meeting in the 
evening of 
27.02.2002.  
Differing from this 
argument it is 
argued at this stage  
that materials 
available on the 
record prima facie 
showed that there 
was a conspiracy 
but who all were 
involved in this 
would be known 
only if there is an 
investigation on all 
the aspects.  
 
6. The Amicus 
Curiae, Mr. Raju 
Ramachandran

recommended 
the prosecution

IPC.  
 SIT did not 
investigate that 
whether Army

(bbb)  Insofar as fresh allegation regarding criminal negligence of fire 
brigade in Ahmedabad under Mr. P.C. Pande , it obviously overlooks 
the fact that fire brigade comes within the Ahmedabad Municipal 
Corporation and not State police .  Mr. P.C. Pande was Commissioner 
of Police of Ahmedabad city and had nothing to do with the 
functioning of fire brigade.   In the complaint, a vague allegation is 136  
 
made that the fire brigade /he lp did not reach on time  when needed .  
However , that was owing to in many of the disturbed areas, roads 
were blocked by putting obstacles.    
(ccc)  Similarly, the allegation regarding post mortem of dead bodies 
at Godhra Railway station being part of larger consp iracy , is founded 
on conjectures and surmises.  The Godhra incident  was fully 
investigated and tried in which no such case was put forth .  Th at 
matter had travelled to the High Court as well and now it is pending 
in this Court .  The issues regarding necessity to do post mortem of 
the dead bodies  in the Railway yard and the manner of doing it , has 
been examined in those proceedings.   In the name of p rotest petition , 
the appellant intend s to enlarge the scope of enquiry including into 
fresh matters such as the manner in which the fire occurred in the 
two coaches of Sabarmati Express on 27.2.2002 , which aspect has 
been thoroughly investigated in that case.   The appellant had gone 
to the extent of levelling insinuation by attributing fire ignited by the 
persons inside the train themselves or by other persons from the 
same community as part of larger conspiracy  to spread hatred and 
violence across the State .  T hat too , with the involvement of the 137  
 
political dispensation at th e highest -level  being part of larger 
criminal conspiracy.   The attempt of the appellant is to bring in all 
other cases (Sardarpura case, Deepda Darwaza case, Ode case, 
Naroda Patiya case, Naroda Gaam case, Best Bakery case, Bilkis 
Bano case etc.) , which ha ve already been  thoroughly investigated 
and tried by the concerned Court including in respect of charge of 
criminal conspiracy at the concerned level in the given case .  That 
cannot be countenanced.  
(ddd)  It is urged that the appellant  is also ill-advised to heavily rely  
upon  certain info rmation in a book written by former Major General, 
who never came to give his statement before the SIT, despite the 
public notice issued on 28.4.2008 after the SIT was appointed by 
this Court to investigate nine  major cases.  The book was written 
only in 2 018.  The veracity of the contents thereof would only be in 
the realm of guess work.  
(eee)  It is urged that the SIT has done everything to the best of its 
ability and as a team , investigated all the nine major cases assigned 
to it by the Court .  D espite the commendation by this Court about 
the humongous  task undertaken by the SIT, the appellant had the 138  
 
impudence to make submission  bordering on questioning the 
integrity of the SIT appointed by this Court ; and though the  work 
was completed by it unde r the strict vigil of this Court including the 
Amicus Curiae  who had taken assistance of all the stakeholders and 
also Ms. Teesta Setalvad.   The Amicus Curiae , in one sense, was 
discharging the role of investigating into the work of Supreme Court 
appointed investigators (the SIT) – investigating the investigators.  
The SIT, after taking over investigation of  nine  major cases assigned 
to it by this Court, filed supplementary chargesheets in all those 
cases and also pursued the cases until the stage of trial, and is still 
reporting about the progress of those cases to this Court periodically.   
(fff)  As regards the investigation of complaint dated 8.6.2006, it has 
been done by more than one investigating officer during relevant 
periods at different point of time as per the exigency  and direction of 
this Court , but the finding and observations of the SIT in every report 
have been consistent.  Significantly, the membe rs of the SIT have 
been continuing to function under the directions of this Court even 
after their superannuation from service, only because this Court had 
been satisfied about their performance.  At one stage, similar 139  
 
attempt was made by the appellant, as  a result of which the Court 
had to stay the trial of Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002, 
which was eventually lifted on 1.5.200986 for the reasons noted in 
the said order.  In fact, this Court had taken note of the 
misadventure of Ms. Teesta Setalv ad in forwarding her letters 
written to Chairperson of the Supreme Court appointed S IT to the 
OHCHR, Geneva  and that upon her undertaking that she will not do 
so in future, the matter stood closed.   It is urged  that  insinuations 
have been made against the Supreme Court appointed SIT and, in 
the process, the wisdom of this Court has been questioned in 
accepting the work of SIT as fair and complete investigation of the 
allegations in the stated complaint.  
(ggg)  It is a matter of record t hat this Court reposed complete trust 
in the SIT not only by entrusting responsibility of investigation of the 
stated crime, but also to ensure that the trial of all those cases 
proceed ed in a fair manner and not compromised, by giving 
authority to SIT to recommend name s of able and apolitical lawyer 
to be appointed as  public prosecutor (s), including  providing 
 
86 supra at footnote No. 1 8 140  
 
protection to witnesses when required.  With the untiring efforts of 
the Supreme Court appointed SIT, trials of eight other cases ended 
in substantia l number of conviction s including imposition of capital 
punishment.  Such being the track record of the SIT, which has been 
closely monitored by this Court from time to time to its satisfaction 
and commended upon on more than one occasion, yet the appellan t 
has gone to the extent of questioning the integrity of the SIT, despite 
the fairness in the investigation.  Such a plea cannot be 
countenanced and is in the nature of questioning the authority and 
wisdom of this Court in expressing satisfaction about the 
performance of the SIT and commending expressly on more than one 
occasion inter alia, in its order s dated 1.5.200987 and 13.4.2017.  
(hhh)  Notably, the stated complaint was submitted by appellant 
– Zakia Ahsan Jafri  and  as no follow -up steps were taken by the 
concerned authorities , a writ petition was filed by her for issuing  
direction to  the competent authority to register the same as FIR  to 
be investigated by an independent agency (not the Supreme Court 
appointed SIT) .  Ms. Teesta Setalvad joined as petitioner No. 2 for 
 
87 supra at footnote No. 1 8 141  
 
the first time in these proceedings before the High Court.  The High 
Court vide judgment dated 2.11.2007 in Criminal Application No. 
421/2007 , opined that Ms. Teesta Setalvad had no locus to maintain 
such application and decided the writ petition at the instance of 
appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri, by permitting her to fi le appropriate 
private complaint  before the Magistrate under Section 190 of the 
Code .  That opinion of the High Court has not been reversed by this 
Court while disposing of SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008 on 12.9.201188. 
(iii)  As noted earlier, even though the appellant  had been  pur suing 
SLP(Crl.) No. 1088/2008 before this Court for direction to the 
competent authority to register the complaint as FIR, this Court 
permitted the trial of CR No. 67/2002 concerning Gulberg Society  to 
proceed , in which appellant – Zakia Ahsan  Jafri  was examined as 
PW-337 on 22.10.2010.  Even before the trial Court, she did not 
raise any matter in her evidence regarding larger conspiracy referred 
to in her complaint dated 8.6.2006.  The material on record would 
clearly suggest that she is being drive n by Ms. Teesta Setalvad to 
pursue and so to say, precipitate her complaint.  The complaint, 
 
88 supra at footnote No. 2 6 142  
 
however, is vague and bereft of allegations of criminality.   At best, 
the allegations founded on the material/affidavits filed before the 
Nanavati -Shah Commission,  were indicative of dereliction of duty of 
concerned officials/authorities.  The complaint is based essentially 
on the statements of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, Mr. Rahul Sharma and 
Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, which may support the allegations of inaction or 
dereliction of d uty by the concerned high officials.  The  claims made 
by these three persons, however, have been contradicted by the 
concerned persons on the basis of contemporaneous record.  The 
complainant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri yet want s to proceed including on 
the basis of statements of these three officials against the version of 
the entire establishment, which is backed by  contemporaneous 
record.   
(jjj)  Mr. R.B. Sreekumar had referred to Register, which was his 
personal diary and not official record , as investigated and found by 
the SIT .  Being his personal diary, it could not be used against the 
offenders named in the complaint and in any case, the contents 
thereof being in the nature of entries made in the usual course of 
official business by the concer ned department expected to act in 143  
 
tandem with concerned official agencies.  The contents of the diary , 
in the opinion of the SIT, were  of no avail .  He had filed affidavit 
before the Nanavati -Shah Commission  in the year 2009 for the first 
time.  In the ear lier affidavits, no reference was made to the said 
diary/register.   Moreover, Mr. R.B. Sreekumar  was posted in Law & 
Order Division only in April, 2002 after the ghastly events had 
alre ady unfolded in February and March, 2002 .  Thus, he had no 
personal knowledge about any instructions, much less allegedly 
given to the high officials or by high officials to their subordinates at 
the relevant point of time  as being in the nature of criminal 
conspiracy . 
(kkk)  Similar is the case of Mr.  Rahul Sharma , another star 
witness of the complainant  (appellant) .  He had referred to the call 
records in question for the first time only in 2008 .  Before that, he 
had filed more than one affidavit before the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission making no reference  to the said call records.  Further, 
in the subsequent affidavit, the stand taken by him is completely 
different.  It is the case of the SIT that after lapse of one year, no 
details regarding call records are preserved by the service provider.  144  
 
To the same end, seizure of mobile phone after lapse of seven years 
would have had served no purpose.  Further, the authentication of 
the call details /records supplied by Mr. Rahul Sharma and the call 
detai ls/records available with the SIT were duly consid ered before 
forming opinion by the SIT.  Mr. Rahul Sharma claims to have been 
authorised to assist the supervisory officer in investigation of the 
post -Godhra riot case, which were being investigated by Crime 
Branch – Ahmedabad city, by the then Commission er of Police, 
Ahmedabad City.  He was neither investigating officer nor direct 
supervisory officer in the Naroda Police Station CR No. I  193/2002.  
He claims to have obtained compact disc containing call details in 
connection with stated case of Naroda Pol ice Station from two 
different cell phone service providers (M/s. Cellforce and M/s. AT&T)  
containing call details of all subscribers in Ahmedabad city and 
Godhra  as case property of the offences under investigation .  
However, he failed to hand over the sa id case property to the 
investigating/supervisory officer of the case, nor got it entered into 
the register of case property (Muddamal) and also not informed the 
Court of jurisdiction about the seizure of aforesaid case property .  
Whereas, he produced the compact disc for the first time only on 145  
 
31.5.2008 , for reasons best known to him.   The compact disc 
produced by Mr. Rahul Sharma before the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission  was then  obtained by Mr. Amresh N. Patel, Jan -
Sangharsh Manch  from the Commission of inquiry, as also, by  the 
investigating officer .  It was not possible for the SIT to obtain 
certificate under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act,  1872  as 
the original compact discs were never produced by Mr. Rahul 
Sharma.  Notabl y, the data from the compact discs were admittedly 
copie d by Mr. Rahul Sharma in his personal computer and in the 
changed format i.e., ZIPPED format.  In other words, Mr. Rahul 
Sharma had failed to ensure the integrity of the data and never 
produced the or iginal compacts discs  of the two mobile service 
providers .  Despite that, the SIT attempted to authenticate the 
available data  by sending it to Forensic Science Laboratory, 
Ahmedabad for examination, comparison and checking the contents 
available th erein.  The laboratory has opined that MD 5 Hash value 
of the files in all the three compact discs were found to be same , but  
the call data records in the CPU of personal computer of Mr. Rahul 
Sharma indicated that the files containing call data records or 
fragments of the files could not be found  on the computer storage 146  
 
media .  The SIT also recorded statements of various witnesses under 
Section 161 of the Code for  tracing the original compact discs and 
authenticating the available data  (late Mr. Ashok Bhat t, Mr. P.C. 
Pande , Dr. Anil T. Patel) , but the original compact discs could not be 
traced .  The final report has analys ed the statements of the said 
persons and the opinion of the SIT  in detail .  It was noticed that the 
call details of the Gandhinagar tower where most of the functionaries 
of the Government of Gujarat were placed, was not available with 
the SIT , as the same ha d not been requisitioned/obtained by Mr. 
Rahul Sharma during investigation of the riot cases .  The SIT has 
thoroughly  investigated even this aspect and all related material  and 
having found that the said material appears to be doctored and 
fabricated and not in consonance with the official records .  It thus  
noted its conclusion that the same was of no avail to proceed against 
the named offenders for offence of larger conspir acy in connection 
with C.R. No. 67/2002 concerning Gulberg Society  or otherwise . 
(lll)  It is urged that the appellant  is heavily relying on the 
statements of Mr. Rahul Sharma, despite the fact that in the 
complaint dated 8.6.2006, he was named as offender No. 45  and 147  
 
accusations against him were specifically mentioned against his 
name in the body of the complaint while also showing him as witness 
No. 5 in the same complaint.  However, the copy of complaint filed 
before this Court reveals that the relevant paragrap h making 
accusations against Mr. Rahul Sharma ha s been deleted alongwith 
his name as offender No. 45 in the complaint .  This is a serious 
matter.  
(mmm)  The case of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt is still worse.  He has been 
convicted for murder (as mentioned in  paragraph 7 under the head 
“Short Pointers” in the Convenience Compilation filed on behalf of 
respondent No. 2 ); and for planting narcotics in the room of a lawyer 
in some other State.  He had  claimed that he was  present in the 
meeting convened on 27.2.2002.  But all officers who were present 
in the meeting, have denied his claim.   
(nnn)  Relying on the observations made in the decision in 
Sanjiv Rajendra Bhatt vs. Union of India & Ors.89, it was urged 
that the same were indicative of the character and conduct of Mr. 
Sanjiv Bhatt, who falsely claimed to have remained present during 
 
89 (2016) 1 SCC 1 (paras 49 to 55)  148  
 
the meeting of high officials on 27.2.2002, where the then Chief 
Minister had allegedly made certain objectio nable utterances.  
(ooo)    The appellant want s this Court to disregard the version of all 
other high officials and to proceed against the named offenders only 
on the basis of version of three persons proclaiming themselves as 
being wedded to truth.  As a matter o f fact, it is urged that all the 
three persons on whose statements emphasis has been placed, have 
been adversely commented upon not only by the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission, but also by the SIT in its final report including the 
damning observations by this Cou rt against Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt.  
(ppp)    Moreover, the appellant  has  repeatedly argued that the S IT 
did not record statement of Mr. Anil Patel, which fact is contrary to 
the record.  At the same time, the appellant placed reliance on the 
statements of Mr. Anil Patel, who has not been named as offender in 
the complaint dated 8.6.2006.  In fact, there are three persons 
having common name.  The first is – Mr. A nil Tribh ovandas Patel , 
the then Minister, Gujarat ; second being  Mr. Anil S hankerbhai  Patel , 
a VHP worker ; and the third – Dr. Anil Patel , a general practitioner 
at Ahmedabad City . 149  
 
(qqq)    As stated earlier, the repeated grievance made on behalf of the 
appellant  that crucial witness – Mr. Anil Patel was not even 
examined by the SIT, is  incorrect  submission.  In that, there are 
three persons with same name and the person who has been stung 
by operation Tehelka is Mr. Anil Shankerbhai Patel, a VHP worker, 
whose statement was duly recorded by the SIT including the other 
two persons with the same name, namely, Dr. Anil Patel and Mr. Anil 
Tribhovandas Patel , the then Minister, Gujarat .  The SIT had also 
recorded statements of 13 other persons out of total 18 involved in 
sting operation, which were found to be relevant for the purpose of 
enquiry into the allegations under consideration.  
(rrr)  As regards the allegat ion regarding dead bodies having been 
paraded, the same has been fully enquired into and the SIT was of 
the opinion that no such event of parading had occurred at any 
place.  However, a novel argument is being pursued  by the appellant 
before this Court.  For, t he allegation in the complaint was of having 
handed over dead bodies to private persons, namely, Hasmukh Patel 
and Jaideep Patel.  During the investigation, it has come to the fore 
that the letter written by the Tehsildar, handing over bodies, 150  
 
mention ed the name of Jaideep Patel, but that was not because of 
the instructions given by any superior authority.  Further, t he local 
Tehsildar has been proceeded departmentally for this folly.  The 
contemporaneous  record including the statements of concerned 
persons , however, reveal that the dead bodies were carried in closed 
vehicles under  police escort , alongwith whom Mr. Jaideep Patel had 
merely travelled.  The process of handing over of the dead bodies to 
the officials of the hospital at Ahmedabad was in fact done by the 
officials/police accompanying the dead bodies and not by Mr. 
Jaideep Patel.  After taking charge of the dead bodies, the officials of 
hospitals handed ove r the same , after due identification, to their 
relatives and the bodies which could not be identified despite effort 
of DNA test matching, were cremated by the local officials at 
Ahmedabad.  There is not even a tittle of material to indicate that 
the bodie s were taken in open vehicles or so to say, paraded from 
Godhra to Ahmedabad or anywhere else by any group of private 
persons before cremation.  The decision to take bodies to 
Ahmedabad was a conscious and unanimous  decision of the 
concerned authorities at the local level and not on instructions or 
directions given by the then Chief Minister, as alleged.  It was so 151  
 
decided  as majority of the dead persons were from Ahmedabad and 
nearby places.   In that, out of 5 8 dead bodies , 4 bodies belonging to  
Dah od, Vadodara, Panchmahal and Anand districts were handed 
over to their legal representatives after identification at Godhra itself .  
The remaining 54 bodies were sent under police escort to 
Ahmedabad, as most of the victims were resident of Ahmedabad  and 
nearb y areas .  Out of 54 bodies, 35 could be identified and handed 
over to their relatives on 28.2.2002.  Remaining 19 bodies were 
cremated by the officials on 1.3.2002, out of which 12 could be later 
on identified by DNA test and 7 remained unidentified.  Henc e, it is 
seen that it became convenient for the relatives of the deceased 
persons to collect the dead bodies from Ahmedabad.  It was also 
decided to take the dead bodies during night time under police 
protection  to avoid any untoward situation.  Such being  the material 
on record, the argument regarding the bodies being paraded , much 
less as a part of larger conspiracy at the highest level, is 
preposterous.  
(sss)    To begin with, the appellant had argued that dead bodies were 
purposely paraded all over, but later improved upon that grievance 152  
 
by showing that parading of bodies was done after hospital handed 
over bodies, duly identified, to the respective relative unti l the same 
was taken for cremation.  
(ttt)    Significantly, t he complaint dated 8.6.2006 neither makes 
mention about hate speeches being outcome of larger conspiracy nor 
it is alleged that so-called parading of dead bodies was resorted to 
as part of larger conspiracy.  
(uuu)  Much had been argued by the appellant about no 
investigation by the SIT in respect of hate speeches .  It is submitted 
by the learned counsel for the SIT that thousands of cases were 
reopened by this Court, wherein ‘A’ Summary Report(s)  came to be 
filed and in some of those cases, charges regarding hate speeches 
have been enquired into . 
(vvv)      It is urged that the allegations regarding build -up or laxity 
or about the post -mortem done in open in Railway yard, failure to 
provide for adequate bandobast  or arranging fire brigade on time, 
are not supported by any credible material, much less to raise a 
strong suspicion to proceed against the named offenders  being 
involved in larger conspiracy .  Appellant  had the gumption to  153  
 
contend , suggestive of the fact that the train was set on fire at 
Godhra by the passengers themselves or by persons belonging to 
their own community who were engaged in doing preparatory (build -
up) arrangements.   
(www)  The attempt of the appellant was to present rambl ing facts 
to create confusion , leaving out core issues  that need ed to be 
focussed to cull out the material on the basis of which an objecti ve 
and decisive opinion c ould  be formed that the offence of larger 
conspiracy at the highest level had been committed and the named 
offenders have committed the same .  That is completely absent and 
for which rea son, the appellant  has  chosen to make such 
pretentious presentation before this Court incl uding not to argue on 
allegation Nos. (i) and (iv) concerning larger conspiracy involving the 
then Chief Minister and other high officials of the State Government.  
Instead , the appellant has  now adopted a stratagem only to focus  on 
the other allegations i n the complaint and further allegations 
mentioned in the protest petition on the specious argument that 
those allegations can be made good  on the basis of undisputed  
documents and record.  This is a subterfuge created by the appellant  154  
 
for achieving the ill -intended design of keeping  the charge or 
allegation of larger conspiracy as noted in allegation nos. (i) and (iv) 
open, by adopting circuitous route  little realising that the other 
allegations are all unconnected and have no causal be aring with the 
allegations of larger conspiracy by the then Chief Minister and other 
high officials named as offenders in the complaint.   
(xxx)      The appellant ha d the audacity  to assert in the protest 
petition that it is open to her  to keep on adding new materials and 
allegations which the Court is bound to examine to do complete 
justice, so that she would succeed in her design to keep  the pot 
boiling and politicising the crime .  This indeed was being done at the 
instance of the group of persons in the name of so -called public -
spirited persons like Ms. Teesta Setalvad.  The protest petition is not 
a genuine protest petition by any standard.  
(yyy)      Indisputably, large number of crim inal cases came to be 
registered after the mass violence across the State.  It is stated that 
around 2000 cases came to be registered concerning the mass 
violence out of which nine  major cases were assigned to the SIT by 
this Court vide order passed in writ petition filed by NHRC.  In none 155  
 
of the cases  including nine cases, any evidence of alleged larger 
conspiracy came to the fore either during the investigation or during 
the trial of those cases.  It is only in the complaint under 
consideration  that allegation of larger conspiracy at the highest level 
of Government has been made, which remained unsubstantiated, 
leave alone creating suspicion against the offenders named in the 
complaint.  If this conjured plea was to be encouraged, i t may give 
rise to uncertainty and possibility of reopening hundreds of cases , 
already concluded and may be pending in appeal s before the High 
Court or this Court.  
(zzz)     The attempt of the appellant is to continue with unfounded 
allegations against the then C hief Minister/politicians/high 
officials/bureaucrats without raising those allegations during the 
investigation of CR No. 67/2002 concerning Gulberg Society  at the 
earliest opportunity after publication of notice by the SIT inviting 
public to give their st atement, if they were so interested and had any 
specific information about such crime.  No one came forward 
including  Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, Mr. Rahul Sharma and Mr. Sanjiv 
Bhatt, who now claim to be the protagonist of truth to depose those 156  
 
facts before the SIT.  As a matter of fact, appellant – Zakia Ahsan 
Jafri, who has been examined as witness in Gulberg Society case 
bein g CR No. 67/2002 as PW -337 was not an eye -witness as such, 
but was only present in the house when the events unfolded.  She 
had admitted of having given statement on affidavit to the Nanavati -
Shah Commission, as well as before the Court under instructions of 
Ms. Teesta Setalvad and Mr. R.B. Sreekumar.  Such being the case 
coupled with the limited remit given to the SIT by this Court, the 
question of directing further investigation of any other matter 
besides the allegations in the complaint and at this dist ance of time, 
would be travesty  of justice , abuse of process and ought not to be 
countenanced.  
(aaaa)  The whole attempt of the appellant appears to be to 
persuade this Court to direct the SIT to reinvestigate the crime  of 
criminal conspiracy , which has already be en tried by the Court of 
competent jurisdiction, in which the accused named therein have 
already been acquitted.  Any such attempt would be infringement of 
their right guaranteed under Section 300 of the Code and Article 22 
of the Constitution.   If the appellant w as so keen, she should have 157  
 
availed of the opportunity  in the form of liberty granted by the High 
Court on 2.11.2007 by filing private complaint  rather than pursuing 
allegations of larger conspiracy or any crime other than enquired 
and tried in connection with Gulberg Society case being CR No. 
67/2002 .  Having failed to do so and being party to the orders passed 
by this Court from time to time on the special leave petition (s) filed 
by them  against the order of the High Court , it is not open to argue 
in the teeth of such directions.  It is now too late for them to contend 
that the complaint dated 8.6.2006 be proceeded as a private 
complaint or be registered as FIR, much less to permit her to raise 
fresh allegations in 2013 by way of protest petition.  
(bbbb)  It is the submission of the SIT that it had done much more 
than “looking into” the complaint albeit under the supervision of this 
Court by examining and questioning several persons and presenting 
periodical reports to this Court including the final  report before the 
Metropolitan Magistrate unlike in any other normal criminal case.  
(cccc)  At the end of the investi gation done by the SIT, it has been 
noticed that the allegation regarding larger conspiracy mentioned in 
the complaint dated 8.6.2006  was based on material which was 158  
 
either found to be fabricated or unuseful , leave alone raising any ray 
of suspicion to pro ceed against the named offenders .   
(dddd)  Involvement of Babu Bajrangi  unravelled from Tehelka 
Tape transcript, does  not have any impact on the allegation 
regarding larger  conspiracy, which alone needs to be dealt with in 
these proceedings.  As a matter of fact , Babu Bajrangi ha d been 
named as accused in Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 
and the evidence against him has been dealt with appropriately in 
that case, resulting in his conviction.  His version in the tape, at best 
would be in the nature of  extra judicial confession to be used against 
him and not against any other person.   
(eeee)  Allegation  of larger conspiracy  at the highest level can  be 
proceeded further only if there is substantive evidence to establish 
the same or could be so inferred on the b asis of such substantive 
evidence.  The substantive evidence of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, who 
allegedly claimed to be present in the meeting of 27.2.2002, stands 
rebutted and falsified by all the other persons who were actually and 
physically present in the stated  meeting, who in one voice mentioned 
that he was not present in the meeting.   159  
 
(ffff)  As a matter of fact, the SIT in the final report submitted 
allegation -wise and offender -wise , concluded that no offence has 
been made out, as alleged against any of the named offenders.  
(gggg)  The SIT had also considered the findings and 
recommendations of NHRC while analysing the entire material 
collated by it during investigation .  The same has been ex tensively 
discussed in the final report from pages 312 -320.  Needless to 
underscore that the findings and recommendations of the NHRC by 
itself cannot be the basis to fasten criminal liability  on the erring 
officials/administrators .  For that, hard evidenc e indicating the  acts 
of commission or omission constituting some offence  is available 
either in the form of oral or documentary evidence.   There must be 
substantive piece of material which will pass the muster of 
admissible evidence before the Court of la w to fasten criminal 
liability.  This is  reinforced from the purport of Section 15 of the 
Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993  or Section 6 of the 1952  Act, 
as well.    
(hhhh)  Similarly, some opinion formed or observation made in 
the enquiry report of any private forum/commission  also  cannot 160  
 
have any bearing on the criminal action to be instituted or pursued 
against any erring official/administrator.   Notably, in the present 
cas e, the complainant has verily relied upon the affidavits of officials 
filed before the Nanavati -Shah Commission referring to revelation of 
relevant fact by certain persons who themselves had no personal 
knowledge  and  their claim regarding presence in the official meeting 
is falsified on the basis of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.   
Merely because  one person claims about the existence of a particular 
fact, does not give rise to a triable issue unless that versio n is 
corroborated  by contemporaneous evidence/material  and more so 
when there is substantive evidence to indicate falsity of his claim .  
The private Commission founded its observations on the basis of 
disclosure made by some unidentified Minister .  Wh en in fact  the 
overwhelming evidence indicated  that no cabinet minister  was 
present in the review meetin g, which was  attended only by high 
officials presided over by the Chief Minister.   Similarly, the presence 
of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt  stands falsified by the consistent statements 
given by high officials who were present in the meeting .  All this has 
been thoroughly analysed by the SIT  and recorded in the final report.  
In light of such overwhelming material, it was not even a case of 161  
 
slightest of suspicion against the highest functionary  of the State  for 
having made any utterances attributed to him by these persons.   
Those utterances being the fulcrum of the allegation regarding State 
sponsored violence, all other incidental allegations  and more 
particularly, unconnected with the theory of larger conspiracy  by the 
highest office, must fall to the ground being unsubstantiated.   To 
buttress this argument, reliance has been placed on contents of final 
report from pages 245 -260.  
(iiii)    It is argu ed that the police report or chargesheet ought to 
contain crystalis ed case about the involvement of named offenders 
having committed the offence under consideration and mere 
perception of suspicion  is of no avail .  That is the mandate 
underlying Section 169 read with 173(2) (i)(d) of the Code.   Such case 
cannot be made out on the basis of personal diary entries as 
observed i n Central Bureau of Investigation vs. V.C. Shukla  & 
Ors.90.   
(jjjj)    In other words,  even if the material collated during the 
investigation disclose s suspicion , that may not be sufficient for the 
 
90 (1998) 3 SCC 410 ( Jain Havala Case ) 162  
 
investigating officer to opine that the offence  has been made out, 
much less have been committed by the offender/accused warranting 
his prosecution in that regard.   It is a different mat ter that the 
Magistrate  for issuing process , taking cognizance or framing charge 
against such person, can do so merely on the basis of strong 
suspicion.   The scale of satisfaction to be reached by the 
investigating officer for being convinced that an offen ce has been 
committed and the concerned person is involved in the commission 
of that offence, is qualitatively different than mere case of suspicion.   
For that, the investigating officer must be certain , at least prima facie  
(in his mind) , that the material/statement on which he proposes to 
rely to prosecute any person would pass the muster of legally 
admissible evidence  during the trial .  Indeed, such a view  is a 
tentative view to be take n by the investigating officer  before 
presenting the chargeshe et for prosecuting named person for having 
committed (cognizable) offence in question  on the basis of entirety of 
the material in his possession.   In other words, the job of an 
investigating agency does not and cannot end in merely establishing 
a prima fac ie case of strong suspicion.   Whereas, he is obliged to 
unearth the entire truth and not merely leave the job at the stage of 163  
 
strong suspicion.   In doing so , the investigating officer does not 
merely rely upon the version of the complainant but is obliged to 
examine the matter from all angles including  to test the authenticity 
of the possibilities emerging therefrom and then forming his opinion 
as to what he would believe to be the true course of events .  It must, 
therefore, follow that the investig ating agency does not act as mere 
post office , but is obliged in law to examine the veracity, quality, 
believability of any material that is unearthed during the 
investigation and then to form opinion  (in its mind) on the totality of 
the circumstances as d iscernible from the entirety of the materials 
on hand  and record that  in the form of police report under Section 
173 of the Code  to be presented before the Magistrate.   The 
investigating agency , by the nature of its duties, is required to adopt 
one version of the events that it would believe to have occurred whilst 
submitting report under Section 173  of the Code .  In presenting a 
report to send the accused for trial of being involved in commissio n 
of offence merely on the basis of suspicious circumstances , 
therefore,  would be a case of abdication of statutory duty of the 
investigating agency  and may not also serve the cause of justice.  164  
 
(kkkk)  It is submitted that there is hardly any argument 
presented  and brought home by the appellant regarding 
shortcomings in the material adverted to in the final  report or about 
the improper understanding of the SIT in that regard.  Given the 
material and its analysis in the final report , the conclusion reached 
by the SIT is unassailable, namely, that no case ha d been made out 
to proceed against the persons named in the complaint as offenders 
for offence of larger conspiracy or for that matter, any other crime.  
(llll)     In substance, it is urged  that no fault can be found with the 
satisfaction recorded by the SIT in the final report that no case for 
proceeding against the named offender has been made out, much 
less of having indulged in larger criminal conspiracy.   Even the 
Magistrate ha d applied its mind to the totality of the material 
produced by the SIT alongwith the final report including the issues 
raised in the protest petition  whil st rejecting the same and accepting 
the final report of the SIT.  To buttress the argument that the 
investigation is the exclusive prerogative of the SIT  including to form 
opinion one way or the other on the basis of the material collated by 
it during inve stigation  and it does not affect the powers of the 165  
 
Magistrate to direct further investigation , reliance is placed on the 
decisions of this Court  in State of Bihar  & Anr.  vs. JAC Saldan ha 
& Ors.91, M.C. Abraham & Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra  & 
Ors.92 and Shariff Ahmed & Ors. vs. State (NCT of Delhi)93. 
 
SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENT – STATE OF GUJARAT  
8. (a) The learned Solicitor General of India appearing for the 
State of Gujarat broadly adopted  the arguments advanced on behalf 
of the SIT .  In addition, he contended that the allegation regarding 
larger conspiracy is being pursued by Ms. Teesta Setalvad only out 
of vengeance, so as to defame the entire State of Gujarat.   The entire 
case in the com plaint was mainly re sting upon the official records 
and affidavits of officials of the State of Gujarat  filed before Nanavati -
Shah Commission , to take forward  allegation of State sponsored 
crime and of targeting the minorities in the State .  Appellant – Zakia 
Ahsan Jafri was used as a tool to further the said design, who in 
turn fell prey to the influence exerted by Ms. Teesta Setalvad and 
 
91 (1980) 1 SCC 554  
92 (2003)  2 SCC 649   
93 (2009) 14 SCC 184  166  
 
lent her name as complainant in the complaint dated 8.6.2006 being 
the widow of deceased – Mr. Ehsan Jafri , Member of Parliament.  
There is material in the final report suggestive of Ms. Teesta Setalvad 
having conjured facts and evidence including fabrication of 
documents by persons who were to be prospective witnesses of the 
complainant.  It is not only  a case  of fabrication of documents, but 
also of influencing and tutoring the witnesses  and making them 
depose on pre -typed affidavit, as has been noted in the judgment of 
the High Court dated 11.7.2011 in Criminal Miscellaneous 
Application No. 1692/201194.  That  fact  came to the fore in the 
admission given by appellant – Zakia Ahsan Jafri during her cross -
examination in the Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 .  As 
a matter of fact, the learned Solicitor General would submit that the 
SIT should have taken steps to prosecute Ms. Teesta Setalvad for 
dam ning the elected  representatives, bureaucracy and police 
administration of the whole State of Gujarat for ulterior purposes.  
Even in the case of husband of Ms. Teest a Setalvad, the High Court 
had strongly deprecated his conduct.

(b) The learned Solicitor General took us through the judgment of 
the High Court, dated 12.2.2015 dealing with applications for grant 
of anticipatory bail filed by Teesta Atul Setalvad and her hus band – 
Firozkhan Sayeedkhan Pathan in connection with CR No. 1/2014 
for offences punishable under Sections 420, 406, 468, 120 -B of the 
IPC and Section 72 A of the Information Technology Act, 2000, 
pointing out observations therein as to how the donation mo ney 
collected by them in the name of Sabrang Trust on the 
representation that the same would be spent on poor and needy 
persons  affected by the mass violence , has been misused and 
misappropriated for their personal pleasure and comfort.  The High 
Court rej ected that application having found that custodial 
interrogation of the applicants would be necessary.  Relying on 
adverse observations, it is urged that the present proceedings were 
not genuine proceedings and the appellant has been set up, who is 
unaware  about the real position.  Reliance was also placed on the 
decision of this Court in Testa Setalvad95, dealing with the powers 
of police officer to seize certain property in the course of investigation 
 
95 supra at Footnote No. 6 2 168  
 
and the observations made by this Court against Ms. Testa  (Teesta)  
Setalvad and her husband for rejecting the said appeal challenging 
the authority of the police officer to effect seiz ure . 
(c) In substance, it is argued on behalf of the State of Gujarat that 
the complaint dated 8.6.2006 had to be proceeded with only because 
of the indulgence shown by this Court on 27.4.200996 by issuing 
direction to the SIT to “ look into” it and do the needful , whereafter 
subsequent steps have been taken by the SIT, strictly under the 
supervision of this Court including close monitoring by the Amicus 
Curiae  appointed by this Court.  It is , therefore,  not open to the 
appellant to question the wisdom of this Court in accepting the 
investigation made by the SIT as completed ; and also directing the 
SIT to present its report before the Magistrate taking cognizance in 
Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002  by reckoning the report 
as one under Section 173 of the Code.  This Court not only selected 
the maj or nine  cases, which were required to be investigated under 
Court monitoring by the SIT appointed by this Court, but also 
selecting the SIT members who enjoyed high reputation and wide 
 
96 supra at footnote No s. 4 and 1 7 169  
 
experience behind them in reaching the high position.  Besides, this 
Court empower ed the SIT to not only fairly investigate, but to ensure 
that the trial in connection with those cases is not compromised in 
any manner, for which it could recommend the name s of advocates 
as public prosecutors and submit periodical report to this Court .  
This Court also ensured fair trial  by requesting the Chief Justice of 
the concerned High Court to personally identify Judges to preside as 
Special Court for conducting the trial of those selected cases.  Such  
is the gamut of directions and sui generis  procedure adopted by this 
Court in relation to the complaint  dated 8.6.2006, whilst allowing 
the trial in Gulberg Society case being CR No. 67/2002 to proceed 
parallelly .  Indubitably, t he investigation could be done by the SIT 
only as per the rem it given to it and on the same logic even the 
Courts ought to deal with the matter on the same scale.   
(d) He invited our attention to Nanavati -Shah Commission report 
and the conclusion recorded therein including about the prompt 
measures taken by the State Government , immediately after the 
incident in question  and thereafter to restore normalcy .  The State 
Gov ernment had to deal with a situation which was unparallel ed and 170  
 
the entire State administration was overrun by such unprecedented  
mass violence .   
(e) In the end, he submits that even though the issues raised by 
the appellant are unfounded and unsubstantiated,  the matter is 
being pursued with full vigour  at the behest of Ms. Teesta Setalvad , 
whose  sole  intention is to keep  the matter alive as rightly contended 
by the learned counsel for the SIT.  The learned Solicitor General 
argues that there is no need to have a relook at the opinion of the 
SIT or case for further investigation a s propounded by the appellant.   
Even in his submission, neither the opinion formed by the SIT aft er 
thorough investigation and proper analysis of the entire material 
collated by it during investigation , is flawed nor the final order of the 
Magistrate to accept the final report submitted by the SIT  and in  
reject ing the protest petition or that of the High Court  in that regard , 
requires further scrutiny at the hands of this Court under Article 
136 of the Constitution of India.   He has, therefore, prayed for 
dismissal of this appeal.  171

appellant, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel for the SIT and

CONSIDERATION  
10.  It is cardinal that upon receipt of the complaint such as dated 
8.6.2006, the concerned police officer , if has reason to suspect the 
commission of an offence referred to therein, ought to proceed with 
the investigation consequent to registration of FIR under Section 
154, since it discloses commission of a cognizable offence.  As that 
did not happen, the ap pellant had to approach the High Court for 
issuing direction to register the stated complaint as FIR.  Had the 
FIR been registered by the station officer on his own, he would have 
been obliged to proceed further as expounded in H.N. Rishbund97.  
In this decision, the Court, inter alia , noted thus: - 
“….. When information of the commission of a cognizable 
offence is received or such commission is suspected, the 
appropriate police officer has the authority to enter on the 
investigation of the sam e (unless it appears to him that there 
is no sufficient ground). But where the information relates to a 
non -cognizable offence, he shall not investigate it without the 
order of a competent Magistrate. Thus it may be seen that 
 
97 supra at Footnote No.  37 172  
 
according to the scheme of the  Code, investigation is a normal 
preliminary to an accused being put up for trial for a cognizable 
offence (except when the Magistrate takes cognizance 
otherwise than on a police report in which case he has the 
power under Section 202 of the Code to order investigation if 
he thinks fit). Therefore, it is clear that when the Legislature 
made the offences in the Act cognizable, prior investigation by 
the appropriate police officer was contemplated as the normal 
preliminary to the trial in respect of such offe nces under the 
Act. In order to ascertain the scope of and the reason for 
requiring such investigation to be conducted by an officer of 
high rank (except when otherwise permitted by a Magistrate), 
it is useful to consider what “investigation” under the Cod e 
comprises. Investigation usually starts on information relating 
to the commission of an offence given to an officer in charge of 
a police station and recorded under Section 154 of the Code. If 
from information so received or otherwise, the officer in cha rge 
of the police station has reason to suspect the commission of 
an offence, he or some other subordinate officer deputed by 
him, has to proceed to the spot to investigate the facts and 
circumstances of the case and if necessary to take measures 
for the d iscovery and arrest of the offender. Thus 
investigation primarily consists in the ascertainment of 
the facts and circumstances of the case. By definition, it 
includes “all the proceedings under the Code for the 
collection of evidence conducted by a police officer ”. For 
the above purposes, the investigating officer is given the power 
to require before himself the attendance of any person 
appearing to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case. 
He has also the authority to examine such person orally eit her 
by himself or by a duly authorised deputy. The officer 
examining any person in the course of investigation may 
reduce his statement into writing and such writing is available, 
in the trial that may follow, for use in the manner provided in 
this behalf in Section 162. Under Section 155 the officer in 
charge of a police station has the power of making a search in 
any place for the seizure of anything believed to be necessary 
for the purpose of the investigation. The search has to be 
conducted by such offi cer in person. A subordinate officer may 
be deputed by him for the purpose only for reasons to be 
recorded in writing if he is unable to conduct the search in 
person and there is no other competent officer available. The 
investigating officer has also the power to arrest the person or 
persons suspected of the commission of the offence under 
Section 54 of the Code. A police officer making an investigation 
is enjoined to enter his proceedings in a diary from day -to-day. 173  
 
Where such investigation cannot be comp leted within the 
period of 24 hours and the accused is in custody he is enjoined 
also to send a copy of the entries in the diary to the Magistrate 
concerned. It is important to notice that where the 
investigation is conducted not by the officer in charge o f the 
police station but by a subordinate officer (by virtue of one or 
other of the provisions enabling him to depute such 
subordinate officer for any of the steps in the investigation) 
such subordinate officer is to report the result of the 
investigation to the officer in charge of the police station. If, 
upon the completion of the investigation it appears to the 
officer in charge of the police station that there is no 
sufficient evidence or reasonable ground, he may decide to 
release the suspected accused , if in custody, on his 
executing a bond. If, however, it appears to him that there 
is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground, to place the 
accused on trial, he is to take the necessary steps 
therefore under Section 170 of the Code. In either case, on 
the completion of the investigation he has to submit a 
report to the Magistrate under Section 173 of the Code in 
the prescribed form furnishing various details . Thus, under 
the Code investigation consists generally of the following steps: 
(1) Proceeding to t he spot, (2) Ascertainment of the facts and 
circumstances of the case , (3) Discovery and arrest of the 
suspected offender, (4) Collection of evidence relating to the 
commission of the offence which may consist of ( a) the 
examination of various persons (including the accused) and 
the reduction of their statements into writing, if the officer 
thinks fit, ( b) the search of places or seizure of things 
considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced 
at the trial, and (5) Formation of th e opinion as to whether 
on the material collected there is a case to place the 
accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so taking the 
necessary steps for the same by the filing of a charge -sheet 
under Section 173 . The scheme of the Code also shows that  
while it is permissible for an officer in charge of a police station 
to depute some subordinate officer to conduct some of these 
steps in the investigation, the responsibility for every one of 
these steps is that of the person in the situation of the offi cer 
in charge of the police station, it having been clearly provided 
in Section 168 that when a subordinate officer makes an 
investigation he should report the result to the officer in charge 
of the police station. It is also clear that the final step in t he 
investigation, viz. the formation of the opinion as to 
whether or not there is a case to place the accused on trial 
is to be that of the officer in charge of the police station . 174  
 
There is no provision permitting delegation thereof but only a 
provision en titling superior officers to supervise or participate 
under Section 551.”  
(emphasis supplied)”  
11.  This Court in Dayal Singh98 noted that the investigating 
officer is obliged to act as per the Police Manual and known canons 
of practice while being diligent, tr uthful and fair in his/her 
approach and investigation.  It has been noted in the reported 
decision that an investigating officer is completely responsible and 
answerable for the manner and methodology adopted in completing 
his investigation99.  Concededly, upon completion of investigation, 
the investigating officer is obliged to submit report setting out 
prescribed details, to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance 
of the offence referred to therein, without unnecessary delay.  The 
report  so presented is the conclusion reached by the investigating 
officer on the basis of materials collected during investigation.  The 
duty of the investigating officer is to collate every relevant 
information/material during the investigation, which he must 
believe to be the actual course of events and the true facts 
 
98 supra at Footnote No. 5 7 
99 Also see JAC Saldan ha & Ors . (supra at Footnote No. 9 1), M.C. Abraham  (supra at Footnote No. 9 2) and Shariff 
Ahmed (supra at Footnote No. 9 3) 175  
 
unraveling the commission of the alleged crime and the person 
involved in committing the same.  He is expected to examine the 
materials from all angles.  In the event, there is sufficient evidenc e 
or reasonable ground that an offence appears to have been 
committed and the person committing such offence has been 
identified, the investigating officer is obliged to record his opinion in 
that regard, as required by Section 173(2)(i)(d) of the Code.  I n other 
words, if the investigating officer intends to send the accused  for 
trial, he is obliged to form a firm opinion not only about the 
commission of offence, but also about the involvement of such 
person in the commission of crime.   
12.  Such opinion is the culmination of the analysis of the materials 
collected during the investigation - that there is “strong suspicion” 
against the accused, which eventually will lead the concerned Court 
to think that there is a ground for “presuming” that the a ccused 
“has” committed the alleged offence ; and not a case of mere 
suspicion.  For being a case of strong suspicion, there must exist 
sufficient materials to corroborate the facts and circumstances of 
the case; and be of such weight that it would facilitat e the Court 
concerned  to take cognizance of the crime and eventually lead it to 176  
 
think (form opinion) that there is ground “for presuming that the 
accused has committed an offence”, as alleged – so as to frame a 
charge against him in terms of Section 228(1)  or 246(1) of the Code, 
as the case may be.  For taking cognizance of the crime or to frame 
charges against the accused , the Court must analyze the report filed 
by the investigating officer and all the materials appended thereto 
and then form an independent prima facie opinion as to whether 
there is ground for “presuming” that the accused “has” committed 
an offence, as alleged.  (It is not, “may” have or “likely” to have 
committed an offence, but a ground for presuming that he has 
committed an off ence).  The Magistrate in the process may have to 
give due weightage to the opinion of the investigating officer.  If such 
is to be the eventual outcome of the final report presented by the 
investigating officer, then there is nothing wrong if he applies t he 
same standard to form an opinion about the materials collected 
during the investigation and articulate it in the report submitted 
under Section 173 of the Code.  It may be useful to refer to the 177  
 
decisions adverted to in Afroz Mohd. Hasanfata100 including  in the 
case of Ramesh Singh101 and  I.K. Nangia102. 
13.  After cogitating over the rival submissions, the foremost issue 
that needs to be answered is about the remit of the SIT to investigate 
the matter further and correspondingly that of the Magistrate , in the 
peculiar facts of the present case.  It is noticed that appellant had 
filed a complaint dated 8.6.2006 by which time the FIR in respect of 
the incident unfolded on 28.2.2002 in Gulberg Society including 
involving the dastardly attack on the husband  of the appellant and 
others was already registered and proceeded further by the local 
police as per the provisions of the Code.  Contemporaneously, in the 
proceedings filed before this Court including by the NHRC, the 
grievance regarding improper investig ation in respect of several 
cases registered across the State of Gujarat in reference to the mass 
violence during th e relevant  period including four crimes in respect 
of Gulberg Society episode were  being examined.  During the same 
time, appellant was purs uing her complaint dated 8.6.2006 
addressed to the Director General of Polic e, Gujarat.  As no response 
 
100 supra at Footnote No. 3 1 
101 supra at Footnote No. 4 1 
102 supra at Footnote No. 42 178  
 
was received, the appellant  was  advised to file application before the 
High Court for issuing direction to the Gujarat police to register the 
said compl aint as FIR.  That petition was finally dismissed by the 
High Court on 2.11.2007, whereby appellant was relegated to file 
appropriate private complaint and invoke Section 190 read with 
Section 200 of the Code.  This decision was assailed by filing SLP(C) 
No. 1088/2008, which indisputably was heard (allowed to be heard 
by the appellant  without any demur ) along with the petitions 
pending before this Court including the petition filed by the NHRC.   
14.  The common order passed by this Court on 26.3.2008103 leaves 
no manner of doubt that the four crimes registered in respect of 
Gulberg Society were to be investigated further by the SIT 
constituted by this Court in terms of the same order.  In respect of 
the complaint submitted by appellant dated 8.6.2006, a specific 
order came to be passed by this Court on 27.4.2009104, thereby 
directing the SIT to look into the matter and take steps as required 
by law and submit report to this Court within three months.  Finally, 
the SLP filed by the appellant  and Ms. Teesta Setalvad  was disposed 
 
103 supra at Footnote No s. 6 and 16 
104 supra at Footnote No s. 4 and  17 179  
 
of on 12.9.2011105 until which date , the SIT continued with the 
investigation/enquiry into the stated complaint and submitted 
appropriate report(s) to this Court.  We must assume, and there 
could be no other import or assumption, that this Cour t was all 
throughout conscious of the fact that the four crimes registered 
pertaining to the Gulberg Society  including the gruesome killing of 
husband of appellant  and others , were already being investigated by 
the SIT and proceeded for trial consequent to  filing of the 
chargesheet/supplementary chargesheet by the SIT.  Concededly, 
this Court by an express order, had permitted those trials to 
continue further.  In those trials, the allegations of criminal 
conspiracy and the commission of crime pursuant to s uch criminal 
conspiracy ha d already  been put in issue.  In that sense, the limited 
aspect of the contents of the complaint dated 8.6.2006, which 
remained to be dealt with was about the allegations of larger criminal 
conspiracy at the highest level resultin g into mass violence across 
the State during the relevant period.  
 
105 supra at Footnote No. 2 6 180  
 
15.  In other words, the steps taken by the SIT during the pendency 
of proceedings before this Court and even after the disposal of the 
SLP filed by the appellant on 12.9.2011106, were under the c lear 
directions and aegis of this Court.  The tenor of directions issued by 
this Court are ascribable to the plenary powers exercised under 
Article 142 of the Constitution.  In that, this Court consciously 
allowed the (four) crimes registered concerning Gu lberg Society 
unfolded on 28.2.2002 to proceed for trial , including the charge of 
criminal conspiracy for commission of such offence; and at the same 
time, showed indulgence to the appellant by directing the SIT to look 
into the complaint dated 8.6.2006 – obviously, in respect of matters 
which were not overlapping with the trial(s) pertaining to Gulberg 
Society case(s) and other cases investigated by the SIT.  
16.  Notably, this Court consciously directed, vide order dated 
7.2.2013107, to treat the statements reco rded by the SIT in 
connection with the investigation/enquiry concerning the complaint 
of appellant as made under Section 161 of the Code; and to form 
part of the report submitted by the SIT to the Court concerned, 
 
106 supra at Footnote No. 2 6 
107 see para 5(y) above  181  
 
which had taken cognizance of Crime Report  No. 67/2002 
concerning Gulberg Society, in terms of order dated 12.9.2011108, 
treating it as a police report under Section 173(2) of the Code.  This 
presupposes that the further investigation by the SIT was on the 
assumption that the complaint dated 8.6.2006 may contain new 
information/material other than already enquired into in connection 
with Crime Report No. 67/2002 – as permissible under Section 
173(8) of the Code.  No more and no less.  
17.  All the aforestated circumstances and the judicial orders 
passed by this Court from time to time on the petition filed by the 
appellant would go to show that this Court had implicitly rejected 
her  prayer to register the stated complaint as an independent FIR or 
for that matter, as an independent private complaint f or being 
proceeded further.  The successive orders passed by this Court and 
directions issued to SIT were only to look into the aspects that were 
not part of the cases investigated by the SIT including the (four) 
criminal cases concerning Gulberg Society - as the same were 
already registered and proceeded for trial, in particular, criminal 
 
108 supra at Footnote No. 2 6 182  
 
conspiracy hatched in the commission of those crimes.  Inasmuch 
as, all other aspects already formed part of enquiry and 
chargesheet/trial of those cases.  Not only that,  even the other eight 
cases assigned to SIT by this Court covered similar matters 
including allegations of criminal conspiracy.  To put it differently, 
what remained to be looked into was only about the “allegations of 
larger conspiracy at the highest leve l” which resulted into causing 
mass violence across the State during the relevant period.  
18.  It is well settled that conspiracy can be hatched at different 
levels.    Thus, the conspiracy hatched at the middle or lower level 
in the concerned cases filed acros s the State, including the Gulberg 
Society incident unfolded on 28.2.2002 involving the gruesome 
killing of Mr. Ehsan Jafri (husband of the appellant) and others, 
covering nine sets of cases assigned to the SIT by this Court already 
covered the expanse of criminal conspiracy concerning those cases.  
It was urged by the SIT that the trial Court in Gulberg trial had 
disregarded the case of conspiracy even amongst the accused sent 
for trial in that case and had opined that there was no pre -planned 
intention to  commit violence at the Gulberg Society.  If so, it is 
unfathomable that any larger conspiracy had been hatched at the 183  
 
higher level, as alleged.  In any case, the remit of the SIT in terms of 
directions given by this Court in relation to the complaint file d by 
appellant dated 8.6.2006 ought to be limited to the allegations of the 
larger criminal conspiracy at the highest level, which allegedly 
resulted in mass violence across the State during the relevant 
period.  In that backdrop, we may have to analyze th e case on hand.  
19.  Be it noted that after this Court, vide order dated 27.4.2009109, 
directed the SIT to look into the complaint of appellant dated 
8.6.2006, the SIT moved into action and culled out the summary of 
allegations exposited in the stated complaint.   The SIT identified 
broadly thirty allegations in the complaint which read thus: - 
“8.  The following is the summary of allegations narrated in the

followed the Godhra incident began with the Chief Minister of 
the State announcing on 27.02.2002 through Akashvani Radio 
that ther e was an ISI conspiracy, and deciding against the 
advice of the Godhra Collector, Smt. Jayanti Ravi, to take 
bodies of the burnt Kar sevaks in a ceremonial procession by 
road to Ahmedabad. The tragic Godhra killings were used and 
manipulated to justify pre -orchestrated mass carnage that 
enjoyed the political sanction of the constitutionally elected

Minister, some of his Cabinet colleagues and top level 
bureaucrats at which illegal instructions were i ssued to

anti -minority stance of the Administration.  Copies of these 
reports are appended in second Affidavit dated 06.10.2004 of 
R.B. Sreekumar to the Nanavati Commission.  
(ix) Indictment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court about in justice 
done to minority community and riot victims in the 
investigation of riot cases in respect of (1) Bilkis Bano case and 
(2) Best Bakery case, as narrated in paras 13 and 14 of the 
complaint dated 08.06.2006.  
(x) Partisan investigations were conducted betraying prejudice 
against riot victims, as indicated by Rahul Sharma, then SP, 
Bhavnagar District during his cross -examination before the 
Nanavati Commission, as noted in Para 18 of the complaint 
dated 08.06.2006.  
(xi)  CM Shri Narendra Modi did not visi t the riot affected areas 
in the initial days, though he visited Godhra Railway Station 
on 27.02.2002 itself.  
(xii) A press statement was made by Shri Narendra Modi that 
the reaction against the Muslim community was the operation 
of Newton’s law of action.  
(xiii) No  direction was given by Shri Narendra Modi to Hindu 
organizations against the observance of Bandh on 28.02.2002. 
Bandhs had been declared illegal by Kerala High Court.  
(xiv) There was undue delay in requisition and deployment of 
army, though anti -minority violence had broken out on 186  
 
27.02.2002 afternoon itself in cities of Vadodara, Ahmedabad 
etc.  
(xv)  Pro -VHP advocates were appointed as Public Prosecutors 
in riot cases as noted in Para 4 under the caption 'Present 
Situation' in the complaint date d 08.06.2006, wherein 
appointments of advocates Shri Chetan Shah (as District 
Government Pleader), Shri V.P. Atre (as Special PP in the 
Gulberg case), Shri Raghuvir Pandya (as Special PP in the Best 
Bakery case), Shri Dilip Trivedi (as Special PP in the 
Sardarpura case), Shri Rajendra Darji (as Special PP in the 
Dipda Darwaja case), Shri Piyush Gandhi (PP in Panchmahal 
District), have been questioned.  
(xvi) Officers at grass -root level were not transferred as per 
State  Intelligence Bureau’s recommendation till the arrival of 
Shri K.P.S Gill as Advisor to CM, as indicated by Sreekumar in 
his second affidavit dated 06.10.2004 to the Nanavati 
Commission.  
(xvii) Failure to take action against the print media making 
communally inciting reports though State Intel ligence Bureau 
and some field officers had recommended for action, as noted 
in the first Affidavit dated 06.07.2002 of R. B. Sreekumar 
during his cross -examination before the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission on 31.08.2004.  
(xviii) State Home Department gave mislea ding reports about 
normalcy in the State to Central Election commission for 
ensuring early Assembly Elections. The assessment of the 
Home Department was adjudged as false by the Election 
Commission in its order dated 16 -08-2002. As per the Register 
for rec ording verbal instructions from higher formations kept 
by ADGP (Shri R.B. Sreekumar), as noted in his third Affidavit, 
he was directed by the Home Department officials to give 
favourable reports about law and order for facilitating holding 
of early electio ns. 
(xix) The State Home Secretary Shri G.C. Murmu was 
presumably detailed for tutoring, cajoling and even 
intimidating officials deposing before the Nanavati 
Commission so that they do not tell the truth and harm the 
interests of CM and ruling party, as n arrated in third Affidavit 
of Shri R.B. Sreekumar.  187  
 
(xx) Shri G.C. Murmu's exercise was for ensuring that officials 
will not file affidavits relating to the second terms of reference 
to the Nanavati Commission about the role of CM and other 
Ministers in the  riots as narrated in Para 52 of the complaint 
dated 08.06.2006 wherein gross dereliction of duty has been 
alleged in not filing Affidavits relating to second terms of 
reference to the Commission on the part of 16 specifically 
named officials including top  ranking IAS/IPS officers.  
(xxi) No action was initiated against senior police officers by the 
Home Department for their grave dereliction of duty in 
supervision of investigation of serious offences as noted in 
fourth Affidavit (Para 94) of Shri R.B. Sreek umar.  
(xxii) No departmental action was taken against Shri Jadeja, 
the then Superintendent of Police, Dahod District for his 
misconduct despite recommendation by CBI who investigated 
the Bilkis Bano case as per the direction of Hon’ble Supreme 
Court.  
(xxii i) The CD regarding telephone calls by BJP leaders and 
police officers during riots was not probed into by the 
Investigating Officers of the Naroda Patia and Gulberg Society 
cases.  The CD was produced by Rahul Sharma, SP, CBI before 
the Nanavati Commissio n. 
(xxiv) Conducive situation was not created for rehabilitation of 
riot victims, though a contrary claim is made by the State 
Administration in its report to NHRC. Instead, the riot victims 
were pressurized for compromising with the perpetrators of 
violen ce, as a condition precedent for their safe return as 
rehabilitation.  
(xxv) Police inaction facilitated riots as part of conspiracy, as 
detailed in paras 13, 14, 61 and 62 of the complaint dated 
08.06.2006 .  In Para 13 of the complaint, some of the 'glarin g 
examples of State sponsored events' are given.  In para 61 of 
the complaint, it is alleged that over two dozen survivors of the 
Naroda Patiya massacre case have confirmed that they made 
over a hundred distress calls to Shri P.C. Pande, then 
Commissioner of Police but that his mobile was permanently 
switched off. There was a similar callous response from most 
of the DCPs and Addl. CPs (of Ahmedabad City) as also by Shri 
Tuteja, the then Commissioner of Police, Baroda. In para 60 of 
the complaint, telephone  calls made from Gulberg Society to 
Shri P.C. Pande and the DGP are alleged but no police action 188  
 
despite presence of three mobile vans near the spot. It is also 
alleged in Para 61 of the complaint that police was aiding mobs 
who were attacking Muslims and that on 28th February, of the 
40 persons shot dead by police in Ahmedabad City, 36 were 
Muslims.  In Para 62 of the complaint, it is alleged that police 
acted as mute spectators to acts of lawlessness, offences, were 
not investigated properly, real culprits were not a rrested and 
no timely preventive action was taken etc.  
(xxvi) No minutes of the meetings held by CM and senior 
bureaucrats were maintained and instructions were mostly 
conveyed through phone which served the twin objective of (i) 
field officers carrying out the conspiracy of pogrom  against the 
minorities and (2) avoidance of the subsequent monitoring of 
actions by jurisdictional officers.  
(xxvii) No action was taken against officers like K. 
Chakravarthi, then DGP,  P.C. Pandey, then Commissioner of 
Police, Ahmedabad City, Ashok Narayan, then Additional Chief 
Secretary and a large number of senior functionaries in 
Government who filed incomplete, inaccurate, vague and 
inadequate affidavits to the Nanavati Commission, as narrated 
in Paras 54, 55, 56  of the complaint dated 08.06.2006.  
(xxviii) Slack review of post riot cases as ordered by the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court in 2004. This was achieved by entrusting this 
work to those senior officers who are willing to act according to 
political interests of BJP and CM, as narrated in Para 84 of the 
complaint dated 08.06.2006.  
(xxix) Nepotism practiced in postings, transfers; promotions 
etc., as narrated in para 85 of the complaint for facilitating the 
on-going subversion of the criminal justice system.  
(xxx) The fact that victims of riots and police firings were 
predominantly of the Muslim community, will establish that 
rioters, the administration, cohorts of the ruling party (BJP) 
were moving in collaboration for achieving the satanic 
objectives of CM. Statistics  in this regard are given in the 
second Affidavit dated 06.10.2004 (Para 3/Appendix V) of 
Sreekumar to the Nanavati Commission.”  
In addition, SIT took note of the following two allegations: - 
“ALLEGATION NO. XXXI:  189  
 
 
That a secret meeting was held late in th e evening of 27 -02-
2002 in Lunawada village of Sabarkantha District and that a 
telephone call was made between 3 pm & 6 pm from the house 
of one Dr. Yogesh Ramanlal Pandya from Godhra to Dr. Anil 
Patel (a member of Gujarat Doctor's Cell of BJP) intimating him 
about the meeting.  Further, another call was also made to Dr. 
Chandrakant Pandya (from Kalol), Chairman, Police Housing 
Corporation.  Shri Ashok Bhatt, state Health Minister, who was 
then sitting in the Godhra Collectorate was also intimated 
about the  meeting.  Shri Prabhatsinh Chauhan, the then 
Transport Minister, who hails from Panchmahal was 
reportedly also called to attend and one Shri A.P. Pandya was 
also present in the meeting. It is further alleged that the phone 
calls were made to invite 50 top  people of BJP/RSS/BD/VHP 
and the plan was to assemble at someone's house in Lunawada 
(Sabarkantha District).  It is also alleged that 50 top people met 
at this undisclosed destination and detailed plans were made 
on the use of kerosene, patrol for arson a nd other methods of 
killing, but the State IB did not or could not track such meeting 
and preparations for the gruesome violence that was to follow.  
 
 
ALLEGATION NO. XXXII:  
A meeting was held by Shri Kalubhai Hirabhai Maliwad at 
village Borwai near Pandawa da on 28 -02-2002. This meeting 
earlier scheduled to be held at the house of one Shri Shankar 
Master but due to large crowd, it was held at Baliyadev Mandir. 
It is alleged that around 5000 -6000 activists of Bajrang Dal 
including Shri Kalubhai Maliwad, Somab hai Rumalbhai of 
Kaliakuvawala, Jignesh Pandya, Prakashbhai of Borwai 
village, Amrutbhai Manilal Panchal, Anil Modi, Sarpanch, 
Sanjay Ishwarbhai Panchal, Vijay Damor, Khema Kalu and 
Damor Somabhai besides others were present in the meeting 
held to plan the  attacks on the minorities in the surrounding 
areas. Smt. Teesta Setalvad has stated that this information 
was given to her by her sources namely Shri Mehboob Rasul 
Chauhan of Lunawada and Shri Nasirbhai Kalubhai Sheikh of 
Pandarwada.”  
20.  The SIT then analyzed the materials collated during the 
investigation allegation -wise, offender -wise, witness -wise and in 190  
 
reference to the observations of the learned Amicus Curiae  – Mr. Raju 
Ramachandran, to record its opinion in the final report (consist ing 
of closely printed/ typed 270 pages in its Volume -I, filed as Annexure 
P-17 at pages 236 -467 of the Convenience Compilation of 
respondent No. 2 – SIT) submitted to the concerned Court.  The SIT 
summed up as follows: - 
“…..  
To sum up, Shri A.K. Malhotra, Member, SIT has conducted an 
inquiry into the complaint made by Smt. Jakia Nasim as per the 
orders of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India passed on 27.04.2009. 
In compliance to the said order a report was submitted by the SIT to 
the Hon'ble Suprem e Court of India on 13.05.2010, in which further 
investigation u/s 173(8) Cr.PC was suggested to be conducted in 
respect of Shri Gordhan Zadafia, Shri M.K. Tandon, Jt. CP and Shri 
P.B. Gondia, DCP, Zone -IV, Ahmedabad City.  Further investigation 
in the mat ter was conducted by the undersigned (Shri Himanshu 
Shukla, DCP; Crime Branch, Ahmedabad City) under the 
supervision of Shri Y.C. Modi, Addl. DG & Member, SIT and a report 
in the matter was submitted to the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 
17.11.2010. Both the afo resaid reports were given to Shri Raju 
Ramchandran, Sr. Advocate, who had been appointed as Amicus 
Curiae in the matter by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of lndia.  The 
Amicus Curiae submitted his Interim Report in the matter to the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of Ind ia on 20.01.2011, vide which he 
suggested further investigation in respect of some of the issues.  
In compliance to the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
India on 15.03.2011, to conduct further investigation into the matter 
u/s 173 (8) Cr. PC, Sh ri Himanshu Shukla, DCP, Crime Branch 
carried out further investigation under the overall supervision of 
Chairman, SIT Shri R.K. Raghavan, Shri Y.C. Modi; Addl. DG & 
Member, SIT and Shri A.K. Malhotra, Member, SIT and another 
report was submitted to the Ho n’ble Supreme Court of  India on 
25.04.2011 . The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India handed over the 
said report to the Ld. Amicus Curiae for his examination and 
independent opinion.  
The Ld. Amicus Curiae accordingly examined the SIT 
reports and also interacted with some of the witnesses including 
the police officers and submitted his report to the Hon'ble 191  
 
Supreme Court of India on 25.07.2011 . The Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of India after careful consideration of the matter passed an 
order on 12.09.2011, directed the Chairman, SIT to forward a Final 
Report along with the entire material collected by the SIT to the 
Court which had taken cognisance of FIR of I CRNo. 67/2002 of 
Meghaninagar  P.S., as required u/s 173(2) Cr.PC of the Court.  
It may be mentioned here that th e Ld. Amicus Curiae has 
agreed with the various recommendations made by the SIT on 
the different issues inquired into/investigated by the SIT.  
However, the Ld. Amicus Curiae is of the view that at this prima 
facie stage offences u/s 153A(1)(a)&(b), 153B(1 )(c), 166 and 
505(2) IPC are made out against Shri Narendra Modi regarding 
the statement made by him in the meeting on 27.02.2002. In 
this connection, as discussed, above SIT is of the view that the 
offences under the aforesaid sections of law are not made  out 
against Shri Narendra Modi . 
In the light of the aforesaid facts, a closure report is being 
submitted for favour of perusal  and orders.  
(Himanshu Shukla)  
DCP & I0, SIT  
Gandhinagar ” 
(emphasis supplied)  
Be it noted that even the learned Amicus Curiae had broadly agreed 
with the recommendations made by the SIT in the final report, but 
had opined that at prima facie stage offences under Sections 
153A(1)(a) & (b), 153B(1)(c), 166 and 505(2) of the IPC have been 
made out against the then Chief Minister.  
21.  This  final report dated 8.2.2012 was taken exception to by the 
appellant by filing protest petition before the Magistrate on 
15.4.2013 raising diverse grounds including adverted to in 
paragraph 6(c) above.  192  
 
22.  In dealing with the protest petition, the Magistra te in the facts 
of the present case, could have and was obliged to examine the 
challenge only in the context of the scope for investigation of 
allegations referred to in the complaint dated 8.6.2006 including the 
other materials collected during the invest igation by the SIT 
concerning the larger criminal conspiracy at the highest level, 
resulting into mass violence across the State.  This is reinforced from 
the observation made by this Court in order dated 7.2.2013110, 
wherein it has been clearly mentioned t hat the statements recorded 
in the enquiry undertaken by the SIT pursuant to the directions of 
this Court shall only be used in the proceedings relating to the 
complaint dated 8.6.2006 and shall not be used for any other 
purpose or in connection with any o ther case.  This clarification also 
applied to the criminal case being Crime report No. 67/2002 
pertaining to the incident in Gulberg Society, trial whereof was at an 
advanced stage (and soon  disposed of on 26.12.2013).   
23.  As regards that trial, all informa tion regarding the charge of 
criminal conspiracy was collated during the investigation by SIT in 
 
110 see para 5(y) above  193  
 
terms of order dated 26.3.2008111 including from persons who 
wanted to make statement before the SIT for giving versions of the 
alleged crimes being investigate d and to be tried in terms of the said 
order.  It has been further clarified in the order dated 7.2.2013112 by 
this Court that the present order is confined to the facts and 
circumstances of the complaint dated 8.6.2006 and shall not be 
treated as a precedent, “in any other case”.  These observations are 
clear pointer to the sui generis  approach of this Court i n the present 
case being fully aware that no FIR ha d been registered at the 
instance of appellant on the basis of the complaint dated 8.6.2006 ; 
nor the trial in connection with CR No. 67/2002 concerning Gulberg 
Society had been stayed pending investigation  into the stated 
complaint.  Indisputably, the directions and clarifications given by 
this Court from time to time in the present case have not been put 
in issue nor any grievance had been set forth from any quarter at 
any stage.  Resultantly, the ordinary  course to be adopted by the 
Magistrate under the Code in other cases cannot be invoked in the 
present case.  In that sense, the enquiry by the Magistrate should 
 
111 supra at Footnote No s. 6 and  16 
112 see para 5(y) above  194  
 
also have confined itself to the limited aspect of allegations regarding 
larger criminal consp iracy at the highest level, referred to in the 
complaint dated 8.6.2006, resulting in causing of mass violence 
across the State.  
24.  Coming back to the allegations regarding larger conspiracy at 
the highest level, it is founded on the alleged utterances made b y the 
then Chief Minister in an official meeting while addressing the DGP, 
the then Chief Secretary and other senior officials of the State to 
allow to vent to the Hindu anger on the minority in the wake of 
Godhra incident.  This is in reference to the mee ting held on 
27.2.2002 evening in Gandhinagar, as testified in the affidavit of Mr. 
R.B. Sreekumar.  To the same end, the report by a private panel of 
former Judges of this Court titled “Concerned Citizens Tribunal” has 
been relied.  This report refers to the testimony of late Mr. Haren 
Pandya, former Minister given before the former Judge s of this 
Court.  Additionally, the testimony of Mr. Sanj iv Bhatt, who claims 
to have attended the meeting convened by the then Chief Minister 
on 27 .2.2002 has been relied .   195  
 
25.  This is the core basis on which the complaint of the appellant 
proceeds to allege larger criminal conspiracy at the highest level.  
These allegations have been duly enquired into by the SIT.  The SIT 
considered the relevant materials while examining al legations (i) and 
(iv), inter alia, in its report113, to conclude that the claim of concerned 
persons is false and figment of imagination .  For that, the SIT ha d 
recorded statements of all those officials who were present in the 
said meeting.  They stated in one voice that Mr. Sanj iv Bhatt was not 
present in the review meeting  convened under the Chairmanship of 
the then Chief Minister .  The SIT had also collected relevant 
documentary evidence to establish the falsity of the claim of Mr. 
Sanjiv Bhatt of being present in that meeting.  
26.  It is, thus, not a case of one version against the other, but of 
false claim set up by Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt of being personally present in  
the stated meeting.  Therefore, t he SIT after thorough investigation 
has recorded its opinion that neither Mr. Sanj iv Bhatt nor Mr. Haren 
Pandya was present in the stated meeting.  Similarly, even Mr. R.B. 
Sreekumar had no personal knowledge as he did not  attend the said 
 
113 pages 245 to 260 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  196  
 
meeting.  Besides, Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was a disgruntled officer.  
The relevant extract  of the said final report114 read s thus :- 
“….. On his return, he called for a Law & Order meeting 
at his residence at about 2300 hrs, which was attended by 
Smt. Swarna Kanta Varma, Acting Chief Secretary, Shri 
Ashok Narayan, ACS (Home), Shri K. Chakravarthi, DGP, 
Shri P.C. Pande, CP, Ahmedabad City, Shri K. 
Nityanandam, Secretary, Home Department, Dr. P.K. 
Mishra, Principal Secretary to CM, Shri A nil Mukim, 
Secretary to CM and Shri Prakash S. Shah, the then Addl. 
Secretary (L & O) were in the said meeting . However, Shri 
G.C. Raiger, Addl. DG (Int.) was not present in the said 
meeting. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then Deputy 
Commissioner of lntelligence (Security) has claimed to 
have attended the said meeting at the instance of DGP. 
No Cabinet Minister was present in the said meeting. Shri 
Gordhan Zadafia, MOS (Home) also did not attend the 
meeting, as he had stayed back at Godhra. Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt, the then Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence 
(Security) has claimed after more than seven years, to 
have attended the said meeting at the instance of the 
then DGP ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  
The SIT recorded the statements of the concerned officials [Ms. 
Swarnakant a Verma, the then Chief Secretary, Mr. Ashok Narayan, 
the then ACS (Home), Mr. P.K. Mishra, the then Principal Secretary 
to Chief Minister, Mr. Chakravarthi, the then DGP, Mr. P.C. Pande, 
the then Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City, Mr. Anil Mukim, 
the then Additional PS to Chief Minister, Mr. K. Nityanandam, the 
then Secretary (Home), Mr. Prakash S. Shah, the then Additional 
 
114 pages 246 -247 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  197  
 
Secretary (Law and Order), Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, the then Additional 
DGP] and after analyzing the same, opined that all the officia ls who 
were present in the stated meeting had said in one voice that Mr. 
Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) was not present in that 
meeting.   
27.  The SIT then analyzed the claim of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt that he 
was present in the meeting by referring to officia l records including 
the call records of his mobile phone No. 9825049398 to conclude 
that he had set up a false plea of being present in the stated meeting.  
The SIT has adverted to the materials collected during investigation 
clearly reflecting on the cond uct of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt including his 
false claim of being present in the stated meeting.  The final report 
has analyzed these aspects in detail115.   
28.  The final report then proceeds to advert to the interview given 
by Mr. R.B. Sreekumar to a news channel on  22.4.2011 and the 
details of the call records of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt for the relevant period 
and noted thus116: - 
“….. Shri R. B. Sreekumar formerly ADGP 
Intelligence, in his interview  to the Star Hindi News 
 
115 pages 249 -254 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  
116 pages 254 -255 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  198  
 
Channel at 12.35 hrs on 22.04.2011 has stated that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt, DCI (Security) had never informed him 
about having attended a meeting at CM's residence on 
27.02.2002 . He has further stated that at that time of 
filing an affidavit before Nanavati Shah Inquiry 
Commission, he had asked all the offi cers of State IB to 
provide him with the relevant information and 
documents in respect of Godhra riots but Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt did not give him any information about the said 
meeting.  Accor ding to Shri Sreekumar, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
was  handling security portf olio and com munal  portfolio was 
being  looked after by anot her officer .  Shri Sreekumar h as 
also stated in the inte rview that it was a normal proce dure 
that if a junior  officer had attended a meeting on behalf of 
senior, he was required to  submit a report t o his  superior an d 
that Shri G .C. Raiger, the then ADGP (Int.) should be asked 
about it. As already stated above, Shri Raiger has denied 
having received any information/report from Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt in this regard . 
 
The call detail records of the Govt. mob ile phone 
no. 9825049398 allotted to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt show that 
on 27 -02-2002, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt remained at 
Ahmedabad till about 1120 hrs and returned to 
Ahmedabad at 1925 hrs. He attended to various calls till 
2040 hrs and thereafter, there is no record  of any calls 
made or received by him. Further, on 28 -02-2002, he 
remained at Ahmedabad till 1057 hrs and then returned 
to Ahmedabad 2056 hrs. The claim of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
that he had attended a meeting at CM's residence on 28 -
02-2002, at 1030 hrs is the refore proved to be false and 
incorrect.  CM's residence is at Gandhinagar, more than 25 
KMs from  Ahmedabad, and normally takes 30 to 45 minutes 
to reach the re. His further claim that he had  seen Late Ashok 
Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja, the then Ministers in the DGPs 
office at about 1100  hrs on 28 -02-2002, is also belied from 
the call detail records in as much as the locati on of the  mobile 
pho ne of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was at Prerna Tower, Vastrapur -
1, Ahme dabad, which  hap pened to be at a distance of  1.5 
Kms. approximately from his residence and Shri Bhatt could  
not have reached Police Bhavan, Gandhingar before 1130 hrs 
by any stretch of imagination. Fu rther, both Shri K. 
Chakrava rthi, the then DGP and Shri G.C. Raiger, the then 
Add l. DG  (Int.)  do not  recollect having attended any meeting 
at CM's  residence at about 1030 hrs on 28 -02-2002.  
 199  
 
Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home) has stated 
that a meeting was held by the  Chief Minister in the morning 
of 28-02-2002, which was attended by acting Chief Secretary,  
DGP Addl.  DG (Int.) and the matter relating to the calling of 
Army was also discussed, b ut no  decision was taken and it 
was decided to watch the situation. He has categorically 
denied that  Late Ashok Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja, Ministers 
had attended the said meeting .  The claim of Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt that he had attended the said meeting at 1030 hrs 
at CM's residence is proved to be false from the location 
of his mobile phone, which was at Prerna Tower, 
Vastrapur -I, Ahmedabad City at 10:57:4 3 hrs. Moreover, 
his contention that the aforesaid two Ministers were 
present in the said meeting is proved to be false from the 
statement of Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home), 
categorically stated that they were not present in the 
said meeting . His subsequent conduct of getting his 
statement corroborated by way of introduction of two 
police personnel would also go to show that he is trying 
to introduce himself into the meeting . As  regards the 
alleged utterance made by the Chief Minister in the meetin g 
called on 27 -02-2002 night at his residence, it may be 
mentioned here that Shri R.B. Sreekumar, the then Add l. DG 
(Int.) had claimed that  Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP 
had informe d him  on 28 -02-2002 that  the Chief Minister had 
allegedly said in the meeting that ''KOMI HULLA DO MA TAME  
POLICE  BARABAR I KAROCHO. TAME BE HINDU NE PAKDO  
TO TAME BE  MUSALMANO NE PAN PAKDO CHO. HA  VE ME 
NAH I CHALE. H INDU ONO GUSSO UTTARWA DO." (In 
commu nal riots police takes action against  Hindus and 
Muslims on one to  one basis. This will not do now -allow 
Hindus to give vent to their anger) . Shri Chakravarthi has 
denied that he held any such talks with Shri R.B. 
Sreekumar. Even otherwise, the version of Shri R.B. 
Sreekumar becomes hearsay and inadmissible in view of 
denial of Shri K. Chakravarti ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  200  
 
29.  Again, at pages 255 -257117, the SIT has analyzed the materials 
collected during investigation indicative of the falsity of claim set up 
by Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt and noted thus: - 
“….. However, on the other hand Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, who insists 
that he was in the said meeting, has stated “that the Chief 
Minister had said that for too long the Gujarat Police had been 
following the principle of balancing the actions against the 
Hindus and Muslims while dealing with the com munal riots in 
Gujarat.  This time the situation warranted that the Muslims 
be taught with the communal riots in Gujarat.  This time the 
situation warranted that the Muslims be taught a lesson to 
ensure that such incidents do not recur ever again.  The Chi ef 
Minister Shri Narendra Modi expressed the view that the 
emotions were running very high amongst the Hindus and it 
was imperative that they be allowed to vent out their anger.”  
Assuming for the time being that the Chief Minister did make 
some utterances , there is a material difference between the two 
versions in as much as Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has tried to improve 
his version by way of addition that this time the situation 
warranted, that the Muslims be taught a lesson to ensure that 
such incidents do not r ecur every again.  Since the version of 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar is on hearsay basis and the testimony 
of Shri Sanjiv Bhat does not have any corroboration, no 
reliance can be placed on either of them . 
 Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has not been able to give any 
satisfactory explanation that when he was in possession of 
plethora of information and was an eyewitnesses to some 
of the important events, then why did he not file an 
affidavit before Nanavati Commission and also did not 
appear as witness in response to t he Govt. circular before 
any legal authority.  He does not explain as to why he did 
not respond to a public notice issued by SIT on 11 -04-
2008.  His silence for a period of more than nine years 
without any proper explanation appears to be callous and 
gives  an impression that he is trying to manipulate the 
things to his personal advantage to settle his service 
matters . 
 During the course of further investigation a complaint was 
received from Shri Dharmesh P. Shukla, an accused in CR 
 
117 pages 255 -257 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  201  
 
No.67/2002 of Meghaninaga r P.S. (Gulberg Society case), who 
is facing trial, in which he contended that there was no 
justification to record the statement of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt on 
account of the following reasons: - 
i. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, IPS is known to be a police officer 
with a du bious character facing several criminal cases of 
serious nature and wherever he wants a favour from the 
Govt. he creates a situation whereby the Govt. is 
compelled to help him.  
ii. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, who had not even whispered 
about any such meeting in the  past contemporaneously, 
surprisingly came out with a new theory that he was a 
part of the meeting.  
iii. That a sudden taking up a position by Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt after nine years of silence and his insistence to 
record his statement only after an offence is registered, is 
at the behest of some vested interest.  
iv. It is a matter known to almost everyone in Gujarat 
that Shri Sanjiv Bhat is known to be an officer pressuring 
everyone to get illegal favour.  
 Since the allegations leveled by the complai nt were 
serious, a communication was sent to the Govt. to make 
available the details of all complaints/pending 
inquiries/prosecutions /departmental proceedings etc. 
against Shri Sanjiv Bhat.  A detailed reply has been received 
from the Govt. of Gujarat, wh ich shows that Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt has faced a number of departmental inquiries and he 
was granted three promotions of Junior Administrative 
Grade, Selection Grade and DIG Grade on one day i.e. 21 -
09-2007, after dropping of three departmental inquiries 
pendi ng against him vide orders dated 06 -08-2005, 03 -09-
2005 & 24 -07-2006.  Shri Sanjiv Bhat, who is eligible for 
the IGP grade has not been promoted because of the 
departmental inquiries and criminal cases pending against 
him.  A chargesheet served upon him on  29-12-2010, for 
irregularities in police recruitment under his 
Chairmanship as SP, Banaskantha is still pending.  
 While handling a law and order situation during his 
posting as ASP Jamnagar in the year 1990, Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt committed atrocities on peace ful and innocent 
villagers belonging to a particular community at a place 
called Jam Jodhpur.  In the beatings by police one person 202  
 
was killed.  The victims included a pregnant woman, two 
assistant engineers of irrigation department and one circle 
officer of Revenue Department.  Shri Bhatt applied 
provisions of draconian law TADA against the innocent 
persons and arrested 140 individuals under this Act.  Due 
to public pressure, the Government got an inquiry 
conducted by a retired Judicial Officer into the in cident 
and Shri Bhatt was found guilty of (a) misuse of TADA (b) 
police atrocities and (c) unnecessary imposition of curfew 
for 70 hrs leading to hardship and harassment to the 
people.  
 The Criminal case of death of a person due to police 
atrocities in the  incident was investigated by State CID 
(Crime) against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt and others .  After 
completion of investigation, the IO sought prosecution 
sanction from the Government u/s 197 Cr.PC, which was 
declined and therefore, a closure report was filed in the 
competent court.  However, the Court rejected the closure 
report on 20 -12-1995 and took the cognizance.  The State 
Government filed a Criminal Revision Application in the 
Sessions Court, which was rejected.  
 The case u/s 302, 323, 506(1), 114 of IPC ha s now 
been committed to Sessions Court, Jamnagar and is 
presently with the Fast Track Court Khambhalia for 
framing of charges against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt and others . 
 Significantly, Gujarat High Court awarded a 
compensation of Rs.1,50,000/ - to the victim who  had died due 
to police atrocities in the above case.  
 Another criminal complaint was filed against Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt, while he was posted at SP, Banaskantha 
District in 1996 by Shri Sumersingh Rajpurohit, an 
Advocate practicing at Pali, Rajasthan and a cr iminal case 
was registered against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt & others vide FIR 
No.403/96 dtd. 18 -11-1996 u/s 120B, 195, 196, 342, 347, 
357, 365, 388, 458, 482 IPC and Sec. 58(1) & 58(2) of NDPS 
Act.  On completion of the investigation, the chargesheet 
was filed ag ainst Shri Sanjiv Bhatt & others u/s 114, 120B, 
323, 342, 348, 357, 365, 368, 388, 452, 201 & 482 IPC and 
Sec. 9, 17, 18, 29, 58(1) & 58(2) r/w Sec. 37 of NDPS Act 
in the court of Spl. Judge, NDPS Act, Jodhpur, Rajasthan .  
The allegations in brief are that  the complainant Advocate was 
occupying a property as a tenant in Pali (Rajasthan), which was 
owned by a lady, who happened to be a sister of Shri R.R. Jain, 203  
 
a sitting Judge of Gujarat High Court.  As per the said 
criminal complaint Shri Sanjiv Bhatt and h is subordinate 
police officers allegedly planted 1 1/2 kg of Narcotic drug 
in one room in a hotel at Palanpur, Gujarat, which was 
shown as occupied by the said complainant, though he was 
a Pali (Rajasthan) at that time.  The said Advocate was 
abducted at m idnight on the instructions of Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt by his subordinate police officers of Gujarat police, 
who went from Palanpur, Gujarat to Pali (Rajasthan) to 
abduct him.  The said Advocate was brought to Palanpur, 
Gujarat and pressurized by Shri Sanjiv Bha tt and his 
subordinate police officers to vacate the said property by 
showing him arrested under NDPS offence.  The said 
Advocate, while in the custody of Gujarat Police and due 
to police torture, vacated the property and physical 
possession of the propert y was handed over to the sister of 
Shri R.R. Jain, Judge of Gujarat High Court .  Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt and his subordinate police officers, thereafter released 
Shri Sumersingh Rajpurohit on 08 -05-1996, by filing a report 
u/s 169 Cr.PC, in which it was mentione d that Shri 
Sumersingh could not be identified in the Test Identification 
Parade.  Quashing Petitions were filed in this matter by the 
accused persons in Rajasthan and Gujarat High Court, but the 
same had been dismissed.  The matter is now pending before 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.  
 Significantly, Gujarat Vigilance Commission 
recommended twice on 15 -07-2002 and 19 -10-2006 that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt should be placed under suspension for his 
professional misconducts, but the Govt. of Gujarat did not do 
so. 
In the meantime, on the complaint of Shri Sidheshwar 
Puri, Secretary, Bar Association, Pali (Rajasthan), National 
Human Rights Commission taking a very serious view of this 
false case under NDPS Act vide its order dated 15 -09-2010 
asked Govt. of Gujara t to pay a sum of Rs. one lakh as 
monetary relief to Shri Sumersingh, Advocate, Pali.  
In view of the aforesaid position, it can be inferred 
that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt is facing a lot of problems in service 
matters and has got an axe to grind against the Govt. of 
Gujarat and, therefore, his evidence is ill motivated and 
cannot be relied upon ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  204  
 
Additionally, it may be apposite to reckon the adverse comments 
noted by this Court118 against Mr. Sanjiv Rajendra Bhatt about his 
general conduct whil e deciding writ petition filed by him for transfer 
of investigation of a major crime registered against him at 
Ahmedabad in 2011 being I -CR No. 149/2011.  
30.  While dealing with the testimony of late Mr. Haren Pandya 
before the Concerned Citizens Tribunal and of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, 
the SIT opined thus119: - 
“….. As regards the deposition of Late Haren Pandya 
before the Concerned Citizens Tribunal, further investigation 
has established that the meeting convened at CM’s residence, 
was an essentially l aw and order review meeting that was held 
on 27 -02-2002 and that none of the Cabinet Minister attended 
the same.  Late Haren Pandya was not even a Cabinet 
Minister at that time and was holding the portfolio of 
Minister of State for Revenue.  Shri Gordhan Z adafia also 
did not attend this meeting, as he had stayed back at 
Godhra.  In view of the version of all the senior officials of 
the Home and Police Department the alleged testimony of 
Late Haren Pandya before the Tribunal cannot inspire 
confidence . 
As regards the entries made by Shri R.B. Sreekumar at 
page 21 on l2 -06-2002, in a  register unauthorisedly 
maintained by him that the call details of the mobile phone of 
Late Haren  Pandya were handed over to Shri P.K. Mishra, the 
then Prin cipal Secretary to  CM through Shri  O.P. Mathur  in 
his office, the same appears to be doubtful as Shri Ma thur has  
denied to have  handed over any such call details to Dr. P.K. 
Mis hra in his office and tha t Principa l Secretary to  CM never 
visited the office of the State IB, as  stated in the said entry 
made in the register. Moreover, Shri S.M. Pathak, the then Dy. 
 
118  supra at Footnote No. 8 9 – Sanjiv Rajendra Bhatt vs. Union of India & Ors. (2016) 1 SCC 1 (paras 49 to 55)  
119 pages 259 -260 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  205  
 
SP, State I B has confirmed to have conducted secret  inquiry 
about one of  the M inisters who had met a Forum of  which 
Justice Krishna Iyer, retired  Judge  of Supre me Cou rt and some  
others were the member, who  had come to Ahmedabad  to 
enquire into the riots in the State. Shri Pathak has also 
confirmed to have conducted secret inquiries, which 
revealed that Late Haren Pandya had met and deposed 
before them and that this fact was reported to Shri R.B. 
Sreekumar orally. However, Shri Pathak has stated that he 
does not recollect, as to whethe r he was asked to collect 
the mobile phone details of Late Haren Pandya or not, 
which again creates a doubt about the entry made by Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar in his register. Shri P.K. Mishra, the then 
Principal Secretary to CM has stated that he does not 
recoll ect, as to whether he asked Shri R.B. Sreekumar to 
collect the mobile call records of Late Haren Pandya and 
that, no phone call details were made available to him by 
either Shri Sreekumar or Shri O.P. Mathur. The said call 
details are not available now. No  disclosure was made by 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar about the said register in his 
deposition before the Commission on 31 -08-2004 or in any 
of the two affidavits filed by him on 15 -07-2002 & 06 -10-
2004.  It is rather surprising that this register saw the light 
of the day for the first time in the year 2005, when Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar filed a copy of the same along with his 
third affidavit fil ed before the Nanavati -Shah Commission 
of Inquiry on 09 -04-2005.  It may be mentioned here that 
this affidavit was filed by Shr i R.B. Sreekumar aft er his 
supersession in promotion in February, 2005.  In view of 
the fact that the register maintained by Shri R.B. 
Sreekumar cannot be considered to be an authenticated 
document, therefore, the entries made by him in his said 
register c annot be considered to be reliable.  
 
Further investigation revea led that  Govt . mobile no. 
9825039852 was  allotted to Late  Haren Pandya. The call 
detail records of the said mobile phone for 27 -02-2002 
have been sorted out and the same show that Late Haren 
Pandya remained at Ahmedabad City till 10:46:55 on 27 -
02-2002 . His location at Ahmedabad City again comes at 
16:24:24 hrs.  and thereafter he remained at Ahmedabad City 
till 22:52:07 hrs on 27 -02-2002 and therefore, this would 
conclusively establish that Lat e Haren Pandya did not 
attend the law & order review meeting that took place at 
CM's residence at Gandhinagar on 27 -02-2002 at about 
2300 hrs . 206  
 
 
In view of the aforesaid position, it appears that Late 
Haren Pandya had misled the Hon'ble Members of 
Concerned  Citizen Forum namely Mr. Justice (Retd.) P.B. 
Sawant and Mr. Justice (Retd.) Hosbet Suresh that he was 
present in the meeting called by the Chief Minister at his 
residence on the night of 27 -02-2002 with a view to 
increase his credibility. It has been est ablished beyond 
doubt that Late Haren Pandya could not have been present 
in the said meeting and that the so called evidence given 
by him was only on hearsay basis. Since the statement 
made by Late Haren Pandya is based on hearsay basis, it 
deserves to be discarded a s it is not admissible under any 
provisions of law.  
 
Shri Narendra Modi has denied during SIT examination 
having state d in the said me eting that  in comm unal riots police 
takes action against Hindus and Muslims on one to one basis 
and  this will not do now, but allow Hindus to give vent to their 
anger .  On the contrary, he claimed to  have given categorical 
and clear cut instructions to maintain pea ce and communal 
harmony at  any cost. He has further stated during 
examination by SIT that a simil ar app eal had earlier been  made 
to the people at Godhra through media.  
 
It has, therefore, been established that a meeting did 
take place at CM's residence at about 2230 hrs. on 27 -02-
2002, which was attended to by Smt. Swarna Kanta Verma, 
the then Chief S ecretary (Shri G. Subha Rao, the then 
Acting Chief Secretary had gone abroad on 22 -02-2002), 
Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home), Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP, Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP, 
Ahmedabad City, Shri K. Nityanandam, the then Secretary,  
Home Department, Dr. P. K. Mishra, the then Principal 
Secretary to CM, Shri Anil Mukim, the then Secretary to 
CM and Shri Prakash Shah, Addl. Secretary (L&O).  It has 
further been established that Shri G.C. Raiger, the then 
Addl. DG (Int.) was on leave an d did not attend the said 
meeting.  It has also been established that Shri A.K. 
Sharma, the then Secretary to CM was on earned leave 
between 19 -02-2002 to 05 -03-2002 in connection with his 
sister's marriage and was not present in the said meeting. 
None of the senior officers, who had attended the said 
meeting, have confirmed the alleged utterances made by 
Shri Narendra Modi, Chief Minister. The statement made 
by Shri R. B. Sreekumar is hearsay, which has not been 207  
 
confirmed by Shri. K. Chakravarthi. Shri R. B. Sreekumar 
has no personal knowledge as he did not attend the said 
meeting. The participation of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has not 
been confirmed by any of the participants of the said 
meeting or any other source. The very fact that he broke 
his silence after pe riod of nine years makes his deposition 
suspicious and motivated and therefore, cannot be relied 
upon.  As regards the deposition of Late Haren Pandya 
before the Concerned Citizens Tribunal, enquiries have 
established that the meeting convened at CM's resi dence, 
was an essentially law and order situation review meeting 
that was held on 27 -02-2002 and that none of the Cabinet 
Ministers attended the same. Late Haren Pandya was not 
even a Cabinet Minister at that time.  Shri Gordhan Zadafia 
also did not attend  this meeting, as he had stayed back at 
Godhra. In view of the version of all the senior officials of 
the Home and Police Department the testimony of Late 
Haren Pandya before the Tribunal becomes unreliable.  
Moreover, the call records of the mobile phone of Shri 
Pandya show that he was at Ahmedabad till 22:52:07 hrs 
on 27.02.2002, and therefore, he could not have 
participated in the said meeting at CM’s residence at 
Gandhinagar.  No minutes of the 27 -02-2002 meeting were 
prepared.  
 In the light of the afo resaid discussions, it can be 
concluded that a Law & Order review meeting was in fact 
held by Shri Narendra Modi, Chief Minister at his residence 
late in the evening of 27 -02-2002. However, the allegation 
that the Chief Minister instructed the Chief Secret ary, 
DGP and other senior officials to allow the Hindu 
community to give vent to their anger on the minority 
Muslims in the wake of Godhra incident is not 
established ….. .” 
(emphasis supplied)  
Thus, the SIT could not have reckoned the version of Mr. Haren 
Pandya, who was not present in the meeting when the alleged 
utterances came to be made by the then Chief Minister.  Such a 
claim made by Mr. Haren Pandya is found to be false.  208  
 
31.  As in the case of allegations (i) and (iv), the SIT then proceeded 
to exha ustively deal with the materials collected during the 
investigation allegation -wise including the two allegations [Nos. 
(xxxi) and (xxxii)] culled out by the SIT.  The final report has then 
dealt with the materials offender -wise120.  While dealing with the 
allegations against the then Chief Minister concerning the illegal 
instructions given during the meeting on 27.2.2002 it has been 
found thus121: - 
 
 
 
“…..  
Illegal Instructions at the 27.02.2002 meeting:  
As regards the meeting held on the night of 27.02.2002 , 
in which allegedly illegal instructions were given by Chief 
Minister to the administrative and police officials. It has come 
to light that an emergency law & order review meeting to take 
stock of the situation was called by Chief Minister at his 
residenc e at about 2230 hrs. after his visit to Godhra. It has 
come in evidence t hat the meeting lasted for half an hour 
or so and was attended by Smt. Swarna Kanta Varma, the 
then acting Chief Secretary, Shri Ashok Narayan, the then 
ACS (Home) Shri K. Chakravarth i, the then DGP, Shri P.C. 
Pande; the then CP, Ahmedabad City, Shri K. 
Nityanandam, the then Secretary, Home Department, Dr. 
P.K. Mishra, the then Principal Secretary to CM, Shri 
Prakash Shah, the then Addl. Secretary, Law & Order and 
Shri Anil Mukim, Secr etary to CM one of the Cabinet 
Ministers of Shri G.C. Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.) was 
present. Since the presence of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt the then 
DCI (Security) in the meeting on 27.02.2002, is not 
established, his statement cannot be relied upon. Shri 
 
120 pages 337 -397 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  
121 pages 338 -339 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  209  
 
Narendra Modi has also denied the presence of Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt in the said high level meeting. His presence has been 
denied by others who were definitely present. Shri R.B. 
Sreekumar has claimed that Shri K. Chakravarthi had 
spoken to him on 28.02.2002, a bout the said meeting and 
had claimed that CM uttered these words. However, Shri 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP, has categorically denied any 
such conversation with Shri R.B. Sreekumar and as such, 
it becomes hearsay evidence, which cannot be considered 
as evi dence for any action.  Shri R.B.Sreekumar, in his 
representation dated 03.08.2009, had mentioned the 
names of a different officer, who according to him, had 
attended this meeting significantly, name of Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt had not been indicated by him. This g oes to support 
that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was not present in the meeting . As 
regards the deposition of Late Hare n Pandya, formerly 
MoS, Revenue before the Concerned Citizens Tribunal, in 
which he had claimed to have attended the meeting called 
by Chief Minister on the night of 27.02.2002, all the 
participants have denied the presence of any of the 
Cabinet Ministers/M oS at the said meeting. Late Haren 
Pandya was only a Minister of State for Revenue at that 
time. Shri Narendra Modi has stated that it was essentially 
a Law & Order situation review meeting and none of his 
cabinet colleagues attended it . Besides this, ther e is 
documentary evidence in the form of call detail records of Late 
Haren Pandya, which conclusively prove that he was present 
at Ahmedabad till 22:52:07 hrs. on 27.02.2002 and as such 
he could not have been present in the meeting convened by 
chief Minist er round 2230 hrs. or so. In view of this the 
testimony of late Haren Pandya before the Tribunal 
becomes highly unreliable . Also relevant here is the strained 
relationship between him and Shri Narendra Modi, a fact 
revealed by late Pandy a’s father late Vit hhalbhai Pandya.  
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security), has claimed 
to have attended the meeting, which is not established. 
Further, None of the senior administrative or police 
officers has stated that the CM uttered the following 
words: " that so far in communal riots police takes action 
on one to one basis and that this will not do now. Allow 
Hindus to give vent to their anger."  Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the 
then DCI (Security), had initially claimed off the record 
during his examination . On 25/26 -11-200 9, that the CM had 
uttered these words at the said meeting. This fact was duly 
incorporated by Shri A. K. Malhotra, Member, SIT in his 210  
 
Inquiry Report dated 12.05.2010 submitted to the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court of India. However, during his further · 
examinatio n in CR No. 67/02 of Meghaninagar P. S. on 21 
& 22 -03-2011, he improved his version and added that 
"This time the situation warranted that the Muslims be 
taught a lesson to ensure that such incidents do not recur 
ever again ". It was for the first time afte r a period of seven 
years and nine months that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt claimed to 
have attended the crucial meeting convened by the Chief 
Minister on 27.02.2002 . Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has explained that 
the then DGP Shri K. Chakravarthi had instructed him to 
attend the meeting with IB's assessment of the situation. Shri 
K. Chakravarthi categorically denied to have given any 
such instructions and has further stated that Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt was not present at the said meeting. Seven other 
officers who attended the meetin g have also categorically 
stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was not present in the said 
meeting . However, Smt. Swarnakanta Varma stated that she 
was unable to recollect whether Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was present 
or not. Besides that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has pleaded ig norance 
about the fact as to whether Chief Ministers alleged 
instructions were passed on by the senior offices to the 
subordinates and also as to whether the same were complied 
with or not. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt is a tainted witness and there 
fore, cannot be r elied upon keeping in view his back ground 
in the police department as he was involved in criminal 
cases of serious nature and departmental inquiries are also 
in against him. It may be added here that even before this 
meeting, when Chief Minister visited G odhra on 
27.02.2002 evening, he addressed the media at the 
Collectorate and asserted that the culprits would not be 
spared and the victims would be paid of Rs.2 lakh each. 
The CM also appealed to the public through media to 
maintain peace. Further more, on  28.02.2002, that is 
within less than 12 hours of the alleged meeting that took 
place on the night of 27.02.2002, the CM has stated on the 
floor of the Assembly, where the Opposition was also 
present, that “the State Govt. has taken this heinous, 
inhuman a nd organized violent act very seriously and is 
committed to give exemplary punishment to the culprits 
so that such incident never recur anywhere . The Chief 
Minister repeated almost the similar facts in his press 
conference held on 28.02.2002 afternoon at C ircuit House, 
Annexe, Ahmedabad. It would not be out of place to 
mention here that in his appeal made to the public through 
Door -darshan on 28.02.2002, chief Minister reiterated 211  
 
that Gujarat will never tolerate any such incident and that 
guilty will be pun ished for their heinous crime. He also said 
that the culprits would be awarded such exemplary 
punishment so that no one would dare to involve himself 
in such an incident.  This would go to show that at -least on 
five occasions, which are fully documented during 
27.02.2002 & 28.02.2002 Chief Minister addressed Media, 
Assembly and General Public and every where the genesis 
and intention was one and the same, i.e. to punish the 
culprits responsible for the Godhra incident in an 
exemplary manner, so  that such incidents, did not recur 
ever again. In the light of aforesaid discussion, the 
interpretations made on alleged illegal instructions given 
by the Chief Minister by Shri R.B. Sreekumar and Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt, appear to be without any basis . Further , even 
if such allegations are believed for the sake of argument, mere 
statement of alleged words in the four walls of a room does not 
constitute any offence ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  
Again, while dealing with the allegations levelled by Mr. R.B. 
Sreekumar re garding illegal verbal instructions issued by the then 
Chief Minister, the analysis of the SIT read thus122: - 
 “…..  
Illegal Verbal Instructions:  
As regards the allegation leveled by Sreekumar, that 
numerous illegal verbal instructions were given by CM and 
that he had maintained a register in this regard, Shri O.P. 
Mathur, the then IGP (Admn.), has stated that the register 
was totally blank on 18.04.2002, when he had certified the 
number of pages in the same and that Shri Sreekumar had 
not disclosed the purp ose of maintaining such a register. 
According to Shri Mathur, the register did not contain 
the “secret” stamp and also did not have a ny title as well 
as the circular stamp of the office of the Addl. DG, CID 
(Int.). According to Shri Mathur, Shri Sreekumar had 
recorded the first entry as on 16.04.20 02, the second and 
third entries on 17.04.2002, and the fourth entry on 
 
122 pages 341 -342 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  212  
 
18.04.2002, which goes to show that Shri Sreekumar had 
not only antedated these entries, but also affixed the 
stamps subsequently.  Shri Q.P. Mathur has challenged 
another entry recorded by Shri Sreekumar that call details of 
the mobile phone of Late Haren Pandya were handed over to 
Shri P.K. Mishra, the then secretary to CM through him and 
denied to have handed over any such call details to Dr. P.K. 
Mishra in his office. During enquiries, other senior officers, 
namely, Shri P.K. Mishra, Shri G. Subba Rao, the then 
Chief Secretary, Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS 
(Home) and Shri K. Chkriavarthi the then DGP have 
challenge d the contents of the said register on the 
ground that the same had been unauthorisedly 
maintained by Shri Sreekumar, which he was not 
officially required to maintain . Moreover, neither had he 
taken the permission of the Home Department to 
maintain such a register nor the Same was put up by him 
to any of the senior officers for perusal . It is, therefore 
reasonable to say that Shri Sreekumar made the entries 
afterwards at his own sweet will with some ulterior 
motive. According to them, this register saw ligh t of the 
day for the first time, when Shri Sreekumar was denied 
promotion. Shri Narendra Modi, chief Minister 
disclaimed knowledge about such a personal 
diary/register maintained by Shri Sreekumar and stated 
that he came to know about it from the media rep orts 
after a long time. According to Shri Modi this diary was 
not a Govt. record and as such he did not want to 
comment upon the authenticity or otherwise of the 
same. All the aforesaid facts and the conduct create 
serious doubts about the genuineness of t he entries made 
by Shri Sreekumar in the said register and, therefore it 
cannot be relied upon . The allegation that illegal verbal 
instructions were issued by Shri Narendra Modi is therefore, 
not established ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  
The SIT, after analyzing the entire materials, noticed that the 
allegations in the complaint filed  by the appellant,  dated 8.6.2006 
are mostly based on the contents of the nine affidavits filed by Mr. 
R.B. Sreekumar before the Nanavati -Shah Commission.  Those 213  
 
contents we re not on the basis of his personal 
knowledge/information.  He claims to have acquired information 
after he was posted at Additional Director General (Intelligence) in 
April, 2002.  Notably, he had not made any adverse comment against 
the Government in his  initial two affidavits, but started doing so from 
his third affidavit dated 9.4.2005, presumably, after being 
superseded by his junior K.R. Kaushik in February, 2005 owing to a 
pending criminal case against him initiated by the JMFC, Bhuj.  The 
allegation s made by him have been duly enquired into by the SIT 
and found to be false or not based on his personal knowledge nor 
could be duly corroborated despite best efforts of the SIT.  
32.  Further analysis regarding the allegation of intimidation of    
Mr. R.B. Sree kumar, Additional DGP, can be noted as follows123: - 
 “…..  
Intimidation of Shri Sreekumar, Addl. DGP  
 
As regards the allegation made by Shri R. B. Sree kumar 
that he was tried to influence to  depose in  favo ur of the Govt. 
before Na navati -Shah Commission of  lnquiry through Shri 
Dinesh Kapadia, Under Secretary, Shri Narendra Modi has 
termed the allegation as false and without any basis Shri 
Sreekumar, Retd. DGP while the  letter as ADGP (Int) through 
Shri S.M. Patha k, the then DY. S.P. Gandhinagar .  He has 
further stated that they used to exchange some sankrit verses 
of mutual interest and used to visit each other in their office. 
 
123 pages 349 -350 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  214  
 
According to Shri Kapadia,  during one of these meeting on 
2l.8.2004, in the chamber of Shri Sreekumar, he took out a 
copy of his affidavit filed before a Commission of Inquiry and 
showed it to him and remarked that he  was a born rebel. Shri 
Kapadia stated to have a glance at the affidavit and made a 
personal observation that no useful purpose would be served 
by telling all  these thing to the Commission, as all 
Commission are paper tiger. He also expressed his personal 
view that Commission was not the proper forum to tell these 
things and said that Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP, 
Ahmedabad City had rightly deposed before the C ommission 
and that he Shri R. B. Sreekumar should also emulate him. 
According to Shri Kapadia, he expressed his personal views 
that Shri Sreekumar was biased in his assessment of 
situation and that the same could further put him in same 
uncalled for contro versy. Shri Kapadia has denied that he 
was sponsored by anyone to influence Shri R B. 
Sreekumar and that these were his personal views 
expressed as a well wisher to Shri R.B. Sreekumar, whom 
he considered as an honest and good officer. However, 
subsequentl y he came to know that Shri Sreekumar had 
clandestinely recorded his conversation and an enclosed 
the transcript thereof along with his affidavit submitted 
to the Commission. Shri Kapadia has also stated that on 
day of his retirement i.e. 28.02.2007, Shri Sreekumar 
called him to his chamber offered him a cup of tea and 
also an unconditional apology for the whole episode. Shri 
Kapadia has also stated that Shri R.B. Sreekumar 
regretted the whole incident and stated that he had been 
advised by his lawyer to do  so as the same could have 
strengthened his case pending before the CAT.  Shri 
Kapadia has denied to have influenced Shri R. B. Sreekumar 
and further denied that he was holding any brief on behalf of 
the Govt. in this regard.  
 
Coming to the allegation made by Shri R. B. Sreekumar 
that Shri G. C. Murmu, Secretary (Law & Order), Home 
Department and Shri Arvind Pandya, Govt. Advocate to 
Nanavati -Shah Commission of Inquiry had tried to influence 
him not to depose against the Govt. p rior to his appearance 
on 31.08.2004 before Nanavati -Shah Commission of Inquiry, 
it has come to light that the meeting was held at the request 
of Shri Sreekumar and the conversation was clandestinely 
recorded by him it may be mentioned here that initially both, 
Shri Murmu and Shri Pandya briefed Shri Sreekumar about 215  
 
the modalities for his examination and advised him about 
certain precautions to be taken the time of his cross 
examination. Rest of the conversation is confusing and does 
not make any sense inas much as there are certain gaps, 
which Shri R. B. Sreekumar has tried to fill in by his own 
views, on the basis of assumptions and presumptions and 
has interpreted the things to support his version that he was 
pressurised, threatened, given illegal directio n, intimidated to 
avoid the revealing of the truth that would harm the Govt. 
interests and to conceal the facts from the Commission. Shri 
Sreekumar has given his own comments, observations 
and conclusions and has also appreciated/interpreted 
this conversation in his own manner, which showed that 
he is not an independent witness and that he wanted to 
influence the Inquiry officer to accept his inferences and 
conclusions. Surprisingly, Shri Sreekumar did not state 
these f acts before the Nanavati -Shah Commission of 
Inquiry, when he appeared before it on 31 -08-2004, for 
his cross examination even through alleged pressure was 
put on him to depose in certain way in the Commission . 
Obviously, Shri R. B. Sreekumar had kept it se cret to be 
utilised as and when the need arose. Further, he did not 
disclosed these facts even in his second affidavit filed on 
06-10-2004 before the Commission .  It was only after Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar was superseded in his promotion to the 
rank of DG on 23 -02-2005 that he filed his third affidavit 
on 09 -04-2005, before Nanavati -Shah Commission of 
Inquiry of his own, and enclosed the transcript of the 
recordings of the conversations with Shri Dinesh Kapadia 
as well as Shri G. C. Murmu and Shri Arvind Pandya.  All 
these facts would go to show that Shri R.B. Sreekumar 
had anticipated these events, had recorded these 
conversations, clandestinely and used the same at his 
convenience, when he was superseded in promotion . This 
would prove that actions on the part of  Shri Sreekumar were 
motivated with a view to let down the Govt. after his 
supersession in promotion. In all the three affidavits filed on 
06-10-2004, 09 -04-2005 & 27 -10-2005 before the 
Commission, Shri R.B. Sreekumar had made a request to be 
summoned befo re the Commission and remedial measures 
ordered as early as possible, but the Commission did not 
accede to his request. In view of this the allegation relating to 
the intimidation of Shri R.B. Sreekumar is  not  
substantiated ……”

33.  In the co ntext of the opinion of Mr. Raju Ramachandra, learned 
Amicus Curiae  noted after the submission of the report of the SIT 
before this Court, the SIT undertook further investigation and 
collected relevant materials, which have been referred to alongwith 
the p revious materials in the final report presented before the 
concerned Court124.  As regards comments of the learned Amicus 
Curiae  in reference to allegations (i) and (iv), the outcome of the 
further investigation has been discussed and analyzed from pages 
401 to 434125.  It may be desirable to reproduce the relevant extract 
of the final report dealing with each observation noted by the learned 
Amicus Curiae , to understand and appreciate the extensive, objective 
and impartial analysis undertaken by the SIT incl uding the further 
investigation done after the order of this Court dated 15.3.2011126.  
However, for the sake of convenience, we are appending the relevant 
extract127 thereof and have highlighted some pertinent portions, to 
this judgment to be regarded as pa rt of this judgment128.  After going 
through the materials and the analysis undertaken by the SIT, 
 
124 pages 398 -467 of original copy of the final report forming part of Conveni ence Compilation of respondent No. 2  
125 pages 401 -434 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2

128 Annexure -1 (at pages 30 8-449 of this judgment)  217  
 
which commended to the Magistrate as well as, the High Court, we 
unreservedly hold that no other view is possible.   
34.  We find force in the argument of the resp ondent -State that the 
testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, Mr. Haren Pandya and also of Mr. 
R.B. Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters 
in issue, although, replete with falsehood.  For, persons not privy to 
the stated meeting, where utte rances were allegedly made by the 
then Chief Minister, falsely claimed themselves to be eye -witnesses 
and after thorough investigation by the SIT, it has become clear that 
their claim of being present in the meeting was itself false to their 
knowledge.  On  such false claim, the structure of larger criminal 
conspiracy at the highest level has been erected.  The same stands 
collapsed like a house of cards, aftermath thorough investigation by 
the SIT.  
35.  We hasten to add that it is only because of the ultra -sensational 
revelation projected by Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt and Mr. Haren Pandya, who 
unabashedly claim ed to be privy to the utterances made by the then 
Chief Minister in an official meeting, the constitutional functionaries 
and this Court was required to move in to action taking seri ous note 218  
 
of the same .  B ut, after thorough investigation by the SIT, the falsity 
of such claim has been fully exposed on the basis of credible 
indisputable materials collated by the SIT during the investigation 
in that regard.  
36.  Besides exposing the falsity of the claims of these two persons, 
the SIT has been able to collate materials indicative of the amount 
of hard work and planning of the concerned State functionaries in 
their attempt to control the spontaneous evolving situation of ma ss 
violence across the State of Gujarat, despite the handicap of 
administration including the inadequate  State  police force required 
to be replenished with central forces /Army , which were called 
without loss of time and the repeated appeals made by the then Chief 
Minister publicly to maintain peace.  
37.  Realizing the difficulty in pursuing the stated allegations [Nos. 
(i) and (iv)], the appellant ha s been now advised not to pursue the 
same and in the written note [reproduced in paragraph 6( www )] filed 
after the conclusion of hearing, confirmed that statement.  The 
learned counsel for the appellant did not contend before this Court 
that a larger conspiracy emanated from the meeting of 27.2.2002; 219  
 
and that, therefore, had made no reference to this meeting in thi s 
appeal during arguments at all.  As aforesaid, we are of the 
considered opinion that the enquiry to be made in this case is 
essentially regarding the allegations of larger criminal conspiracy at 
the highest level.  That itself has , now , in a way, been ab andoned by 
the appellant in this appeal.  It must follow that no other aspect 
needs to be examined in this appeal as the finding of the Magistrate 
and of the High Court in that regard, is being allowed to become 
final.  
38.  It is in this context the learned counsel for the SIT had urged 
that the appellant  has  been changing goalpost at every stage of the 
proceedings before different Courts.  It is seen that the allegation of 
larger criminal conspiracy at the highest level  spelt out in the 
complaint and  protest petition, was in reference to the sensational 
revelation made by Mr. Sanjeev Bhatt and Mr. Haren Pandya , the 
falsity whereof has been exposed by the SIT .  As a result, now the 
appellant is pursuing the same allegation by relying on so -called 
undis puted extra -judicial confessions recorded in Tehelka tapes on 
the specious plea that there can be no direct evidence regarding 
larger conspiracy .  Hence, in this appeal, t he entire focus of the 220  
 
appellant has been to highlight the so -called undisputed extra  
judicial confessions recorded in Tehelka tapes to be read with the 
inaction of the officials demonstrable from the undisputed official 
documents to establish a larger conspiracy and which according to 
the appellant, has not been enquired into by the SIT.  The stated 
undisputed evidence, according to the appellant, points to a larger 
conspiracy, which appears to involve bureaucrats, politicians, public 
prosecutors, VHP, RSS, Bajrang Dal and members of the State 
political establishment.   
39.  This argument, we u nhesitatingly opine, is nothing short of red 
herring.  In that, emphasis has been placed on evidence such as SIB 
messages.  What has been conveniently glossed over is that, to make 
out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a 
link indicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for 
commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period 
across the State including the heart -rending episode unfolded at 
Godhra on 27.2.2002, in which large number of Kar -sevaks were 
burnt alive in train bogies.  No such link is forthcoming, much less 
had been unraveled and established in any of the nine (9) cases 
investigated by the same SIT under the directions of this Court.  
Accepting the argument of the appellant would require us t o 221  
 
question the wisdom of this Court and to hold that even the incident 
at Godhra unfolded on 27.2.2002 was also the outcome of alleged 
larger criminal conspiracy.  Such a view would be preposterous.   
40.  In that, the Godhra incident has been fully enquired in to by the 
SIT to the satisfaction of this Court and even the trial had ended in 
recording conviction against the concerned accused (belonging to 
minority community).  As to how the Godhra incident unfolded, has 
been analyzed by the High Court in confirmati on appeals in Godhra 
train case about the acts of planning and commission by a group of 
persons.  Suffice it to observe that forwarding of messages by the 
intelligence agencies including inaction or lack of effective measures 
taken by the concerned officia ls per se  does not imply criminal 
conspiracy on the part of the State authorities.  As stated earlier, 
absent tangible material suggestive of a chain or any perceivable link 
or connection with the unfolding of mass violence across the State, 
it is unfathomable as t o how the SIT could have still recommended 
sending  the alleged offenders for trial, much less would obligate the 
concerned Court to take cognizance on such unfounded allegations.  
There is no material forthcoming to indicate that there was failure 
on the p art of intelligence to collect information and it was a 
deliberate act on the part of the State Government authorities.  222  
 
Whereas, the allegation is that intelligence inputs were collected and 
disseminated to concerned authorities , but not acted upon by the  
concerned officials in right earnest.  
41.  Needless to underscore that inaction of the duty holders to take 
those messages to its logical end, cannot be regarded as act of 
criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding 
the meeting of mi nds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread 
mass violence across the State.  The SIT had recorded statement of 
Mr. Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home), Gujarat, dated 
12.12.2009, who stated as follows: - 
“….. The State of Gujarat has a long history  of communal 
riots way back to  1714. Thereafter riots had erupted in the 
State on many occasions during the last  three centuries. 
However, post -independence, major riots took place in the 
State  in 1969, 1985 and 1992 -93. Inputs regarding the 
communal situa tion in the State  had been received from the 
State Intelligence Bureau as well as Intelligence  Bureau, 
Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. This 
information was sent  to the concerned authorities to initiate 
appropriate preventive and remedial  mea sures. Actionable 
information was analysed and communicated to the DGP  and 
other field formation for further necessary action.   
At the time when I took over as ACS (H), the communal 
atmosphere in  Gujarat State was neither surcharged nor 
volatile prior to 2 7.02.2002. It may be  mentioned here that the 
programme of Shilanyas for Ram Mandir at Ayodhya was  
announced quite a few months back to be done on 15th March 
2002 and this  announcement had arose some passions across 
the country. In Gujarat State  Intelligenc e outputs were 
available to the government about the movement of the  
Karsevaks from different places in Gujarat to Ayodhya. 
Keeping in view this  information all SsP/CsP were alerted on 
07.02.2002 about the movements of  Karsevaks. The 
Government had specifi c information that on 16.02.2002 that 
Shri  Prahladbhai J. Patel, President of Bajrang Dal would leave 
for Ayodhya for Maha  Yagna along with 150 -200 persons. 
Further on 22.02.2002 he will depart from  Mehsana railway 223  
 
station at 15.40 hours by Delhi -Ahmedabad  Mail train for  
Ahmedabad and on 24.02.2002 they would leave Ahmedabad 
railway station by  Sabarmati Express train 9165 Dn. at 20.25 
hours for Ayodhya. Also there was  information that they will 
return on 26.02.2002 from Ayodhya at night and would  reach 
Ahmedabad on 28.02.2002 morning. The group was supposed 
to carry  Trishuls with them. Accordingly this message was 
passed on by SP Western  Railway, Vadodara Gujarat to IG 
Communal Intelligence, UP, Lucknow vide fax  message dated 
16.02.2002. However, no spec ific information had been 
received  from the IG Communal Intelligence, UP about the 
return journey of Karsevaks or  from anyone else……”  
This version belies the claim of the appellant including the 
unfounded allegation of criminal conspiracy at the highest le vel for 
causing mass violence across the State.  The materials gathered by 
the SIT on the other hand, would suggest that despite the corrective 
measures taken by the concerned officials in right earnest, the 
situation evolved in unpredictable and sporadic manner and the 
expanse of the activities were such that the State administration was 
completely overrun.  
42.  At the cost of repetition, be it noted that the SIT had not found 
any conspiracy for linking the separate incidents of mass violence 
across the State d uring the investigation of nine (9) separate crimes 
including the Godhra train incident, dealt with by the SIT under the 
strict vigil and supervision of this Court and ably assisted by the 
learned Amicus Curiae  playing the role of devil’s advocate.  Wherea s, 
the messages generated by SIB from time to time even before 224  
 
27.2.2002, in fact would go to show that the concerned officials were 
vigilant, but the situation as evolved post Godhra incident, was 
unparalleled and had overrun the State administration.  
43.  In any case, inaction or failure of some officials of one section 
of the State administration cannot be the basis to infer a pre -
planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State 
Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence) 
against  the minority community.   The SIT had noted that inaction 
and negligence of the erring officials has been taken note of at the 
appropriate level including by initiating departmental action against 
them.  Such inaction or negligence cannot pass the muster of 
hatching of a criminal conspiracy, for which the degree of 
participation in the planning of commission of an offence of this 
magnitude must come to the fore in some way.  The SIT was not 
there to enquire into the failures of the State administration, bu t the 
remit given to it by this Court was to enquire into the allegations of 
larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level).   
44.  Conspiracy cannot be readily inferred merely on the basis of 
the inaction or failure of the State administration.  In the enqu iry 225  
 
undertaken by the SIT, it had been found that the developments 
were in quick succession and had overrun the arrangements already 
in place or for that matter, additional support by calling Army on 
28.2.2002 itself besides the curfew imposed in the most disturbed 
areas of the State.  In light of such timely corrective measures taken 
by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public 
assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be 
punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace , it would be 
beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear 
suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and 
hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, 
much less grave or strong suspicion as being the  quintessence for 
sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy.  
45.  The protagonists of quest for justice sitting in a comfortable 
environment in their air -conditioned office may succeed in 
connecting failures of the State administration  at different levels 
during such horrendous situation, little knowing or even referring to 
the ground realities and the continual effort put in by the duty 
holders in controlling the spontaneous evolving situation unfolding 
aftermath mass viol ence across the State .  T he linking of such 226  
 
failures is not enough to entertain a suspicion about hatching of 
criminal conspiracy  at the highest level , which requires a concerted 
effort of all the persons concerned and more importantly, clear 
evidence about meeting of the minds to accomplish such design, 
much less of causing and precipitating mass violence across the 
State.  It is apposite to recall the observations in Reg vs. Hodge128A, 
adverting to the address by Baron Alderson about the dexterity an d 
ability of ingenious mind to create theories, where he had said: - 
“The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting 
circumstances to one another, and even in straining them a 
little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one connected 
whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the 
more likely was it, considering such matters, to overreach and 
mislead itself, to supply some little link that is wanting, to 
take for granted some fact consistent with its previous 
theories and necessary to render them complete.”  
Be that as it may, o verrunning of State administration is not an 
unknown phenomenon.  It has been witnessed all over the globe 
during the second wave of pandemic, where the countries with even 
best of medical facilities crumbled and their management skills were  
overrun under the pressure.  Can it be said  to be a case of  hatching 
of criminal conspiracy?   We need not multiply such instances of 
overrun.   Breakdown of law -and -order situation if for short duration , 
 
128A (1838) 2 Lew 227, referred to in Hanumant, son of Govind Nargundkar vs. State of Madhya Pradesh  –  
       1952 SCR 1091  227  
 
cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law  or 
constitutional crisis .  To put it differently, misgovernance or failure 
to maintain law -and -order during a brief period may not be a case 
of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets 
embodied in Article 356  of the Constitution .  There must be credible 
evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law -and -order 
situatio n; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of  failure 
of State administration to control th e situation .  Suffice it to observe 
that the breakdown of law -and -order  situation in the State including 
attributable to the alleged  inaction of the (State ) duty holders, owing 
to spontaneous mass violence cannot be a safe measure to infer as 
being a part of the criminal conspiracy at the highest level of political 
dispensation unless there is clear evidence to so conclude regarding 
meeting of the minds  of all concerned and their concerted efforts to 
commit or promote commission of such crime.  The allegati on in the 
present case , if at all relevant , was founded on falsehood of the claim 
of Mr. Sanjeev Bhatt and Mr. Haren Pandya regarding the utterances 
of the then Chief Mini ster in review meeting chaired by him – which 
stood completely exposed  after the investigation by the SIT.  228  
 
46.  For the same reason, it would not be open to the concerned 
Court to take cognizance or to call upon the SIT to do further 
investigation absent any tangible material.  On the other hand, the 
opinion recorded by the SIT while dealing with allegation No. (viii)129, 
has dealt with the materials to conclude that it cannot be said that 
no action had been taken on letters sent by Mr. R.B. Sreekumar.  
Similarly, while dealing with the allegation [No. (xiv)] regarding 
undue delay in requisition and deployment of Army130, the SIT had 
opine d that there was genuine problem of deploying Army despite 
sending of requisition on 28.2.2002 at 1300 hrs., which message 
was sent by fax to the Union Defence Secretary, Ministry of Defence 
at 1430 hrs. and the time taken in posting the Army after its arr ival 
due to logistical reasons.   
47.  Suffice it to observe that there is no tittle of material, much less 
tangible material to support the plea of the appellant that the 
Godhra incident unfolded on 27.2.2002 and the events which 
followed, was a pre -planned ev ent owing to the criminal conspiracy 
hatched at the highest level in the State.  It is well settled that 
 
129 pages 280 -283 of original copy of th e final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of respondent No. 2  
130 pages 293 -294 and 342 -343 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of    
respondent No. 2  229  
 
conspiracy requires an act ( actus reus) and an accompanying mental 
state ( mens rea ).  The agreement constitutes the act and the 
intention to achieve th e unlawful objective of that agreement 
constitutes the required mental state.  The offence of conspiracy is 
independent of other offences .  It takes place when there is an 
agreement to do or cause to be done an illegal act , or an act which 
may not be illeg al but by illegal means.  The rationale of conspiracy 
is that the required objective manifestations of dispositions of 
criminality is provided by the act of agreement.  To convict a person 
of conspiracy, the prosecution must show that he agreed with others  
that together they will accomplish the unlawful object of the 
conspiracy131.  As noted earlier, inaction in the response or even in 
a given case of non -responsive administration, can be no basis to 
infer hatching of criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State 
Government in absence of any clear evidence about the meeting of 
minds; and that, failure to respond to the messages sent by SIB was 
a concerted and deliberate act of omission or commission on the part 
of the State and other functi onaries, as alleged.  The SIT had 
recorded the statements of all concerned including the officials 
 
131 See Firozuddin Basheeruddin  (supra at Footnote No. 43), R. Venkatkrishnan  (supra at Footnote No. 45), Shiv 
Charan Bansal (supra at Footnote No. 4 6), and Nazir Khan  (supra at Footnote No. 5 9) 230  
 
before forming the opinion, as noted in the final report, to discard 
the allegation under consideration.  The Magistrate, as well as, the 
High Court committe d no error whatsoever in accepting the final 
report presented by the SIT.  
48.  Thus understood, the argument pressed into service about the 
existence of materials regarding build -up of communal mobilizations 
and stockpiling of weapons, arms and ammunitions even  before the 
Godhra episode on 27.2.2002 being part of the larger criminal 
conspiracy, is devoid of merits.  This argument proceeded on an 
erroneous assumption that the SIT had not investigated into this 
crucial matter.  The final report presented by the SI T before the 
concerned Court has dealt with the relevant aspects while 
considering allegation No. (viii)132, as also, under the heading 
“Failure to Act on Suggestions From State Intelligence”, while 
considering the allegations against the then Chief Ministe r133, in the 
following words: -

Committee under the Chairmanship of the Governor of 
the State; Leader of Opposition and others to supervise 
the relief operation . He has further stated that the relief 
camps were opened in the affected area s served by the NGOs 
and local social leaders. He has also stated that the funds 
were contributed by the Govt. as per policy and the relief 
operations supervised by the Committee. According to Shri 
Modi, the necessary food, drinking water, medicines and 
cash, etc were arranged in these camps and arrangements 
also made for the children education in these camps. 
According to Shri Modi, some PIL had been filed in this regard 
in Gujarat High Court and the same should be looked 
into ……”  
 
And again:  
 “…..  As regards the DO letter dated 24 -04-2002 sent by 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar, the then Addl. DG (Int.) to Shri Ashok 
Narayan, the then ACS (Home).  Shri Narendra Modi has 
stated that no such letter was put up to him.  However, Shri 
Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Ho me) has stated that the 
letter contained general observations and concrete 
details were missing and therefore, he had discussed 
from Shri R.B. Sreekumar and requested him to take 
action at his level as far as possible. Shri Ashok Narayan 
does not recollect  having put up this letter to CM. Shri 
K. Chakravarthi the then DGP has stated that m ost of the 
points and issues raised by Shri R.B. Sreekumar had been 
effect1vely dealt with in March & April, 2002 . Shri 
Chakravarthi has also stated to have taken adequate  steps 
to restore the loss of faith of the minority community in the 
Criminal Justice System by instructing the concerned police 
officers to be fair to ensure proper registration of FIR effect 
arrests of the accused persons and to proceed ahead With 
the in vestigation as per law. Shri Chakravarthi has also 
stated that the, teams of the police officers were sent to the 
relief camps for direct contact with the affected persons and 
to proceed with the investigation in a fair manner. Shri 
Chakravarthi has also s poken of having given instruction to 
the senior officers to closely supervise these cases to avoid 
any allegations. According to Shri Chakravarthi, special 
instruction was given by him to all the police officers to 
provide suitable protection to those who wanted to return to 
their original residence I Business. Regarding the law & order 
situation, review report sent by Shri R.B. Sreekumar to Home 
Department on 15 -06-2002, requesting the postponement of 
the Rath -Yatra till an atmosphere of durable peace and 
goodwill was established between the majority a nd minority 
community, Shri Ashok Narayan has stated to have 
discussed the matter with Chief Minister, who did not agree 
with the views of Shri Sreekumar to stop the Rath -Yatra, as 232  
 
this was an event in vogue for so many years. Shri Ashok has 
also stated th at the Administration did not agree with the 
view of Shri Sreekumar and the Rath -Yatra was taken out on 
12-07-2002, under police bandobast and the event passed 
off peacefully.  Further, according to Shri Chakravarthi, 
these were the personal views of Shri Sreekumar, which were 
duly considered by the Govt.  Shri Chakravarthi has also 
stated that the report sent by Shri Sreekumar was not well 
through of and was not based on realities and therefore Govt. 
did not agree with the view of Shri Sreekumar and that h is 
apprehensions were without any basis.  Coming to another 
report on the prevailing law & order situation sent vide letter 
dated 30 -08-2002 with the approval of Shri Sreekumar, it 
may be mentioned that the gist of presentation made before 
the Election Com mission on 09 -08-2002, was included in the 
same.  In nutshell Shri Sreekumar projected in this letter 
that the communal tension continued and the communal gap 
had widened between Hindus and Muslims and that any 
minor issue would reignite communal passions resulting in 
clashes as had been witnessed in Dhoraji, Rajkot on 17 -08-
2002.  Shri Ashok Narayan has stated that he sent a DO 
letter dated 09 -09-2002 to Shri Sreekumar that his 
assessment of law & order situation conveyed on 20 -08-
2002, was not in tune wit h the feedback received by him from 
other agencies.  Shri Ashok Narayan has further pointed 
out that some feeling of insecurity amongst the minority 
community was understandable in isolated pockets, but 
the same did not indicate the feelings of insecurity 
anymore.  Shri Ashok Narayan disagreed with the views 
of Shri Sreekumar on the ground that no broad based 
inputs were relied upon by him before arriving at a 
conclusion.  As regards the letter dated 28 -08-2002 Shri 
Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home) has st ated that he 
did not recall the action taken by him on the said letter, 
but the suggestions made therein seemed logical and in 
normal course action must have been taken by the Home 
Department.  Shri K. Chakravarthi has stated that as far 
as police departme nt was concerned, he had given 
directions based on his suggestions .  However, the relevant 
files on the subject have not been made available by the Govt. 
of Gujarat.  Keeping in view the versions of Shri Ashok 
Narayan, Shri K. Chakravarthi and Shri Narendr a Modi 
about the Rath -Yatra and also about the DO letter dated 09 -
09-2002 sent by Shri Ashok Narayan to Shri Sreekumar, it 
can not be said that no action was taken on the views 
sent by the latter to the Govt.  In view of the position 
explained above the al legation is not established ……”

49.  Reverting to the allegation coined as “Allegations Carried by 
Tehelka Magazine”, the final report deals with the same as 
follows134:- 
“…..  
Allegations carried by Tehelka magazine : 
When confronted with the interviews given by Shri Haresh 
Bhatt, the then MLA, Babu Bajrangi and Rajendra Vyas, 
President, VHP Ahmedabad City to Shri Ashish Khetan, 
Special Correspondent, Tehelka, Shri Narender Modi has 
stated that the allegations leveled against him were false  and 
incorrect.  He has further stated that this issue was raised in 
November 2007 , after about six years of incident and that too 
at the time of elections in December, 2007 .  Further, these 
issues were again raked up in April 2008 when the SIT was 
appointed by the Supreme Court.  Shri Modi has also stated 
that this issue was again raised on 22 -02-2010, when he was 
to appear before the SIT for his examination.  According to Shri 
Modi, the whole episode is motivated and stage managed and 
that he had n o personal knowledge about the authenticity of 
the said CD.  
 In this connection, it may be added here that Shri Haresh 
Bhatt, formerly MLA  and accused Babu Bajrangi  in Naroda 
Patiya case have admitted their voice as also the contents of 
the CD.  Shri Hares h Bhatt has stated that one Shri Ashish 
had approached him that he wanted to write a thesis on 
Hindutva and wanted him to contribute some spicy material 
for the same, so that he could succeed in his mission.  He has 
further stated that Ashish visited him a t his residence in 
Ahmedabad City as well as at Godhra at least 7 -8 times in a 
month period and when the reference came to Gujarat riots, 
he gave an imaginary story as Ashish wanted some spicy 
material for his thesis.  He has stated that the talks about a 
CBI inquiry, the fact that he owned a gun factory where 
diesel bombs and pipe bombs were made and distributed to 
Hindus, the fact about two truck load of swords ordered 
from Punjab and subsequently distributed amongst 
Hindus, making of a rocket launcher in  his gun factory by 
filling them with gun powder and lighting a 595 local made 
 
134 page 352 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  234  
 
bomb to blast were absolutely false and baseless.  He has 
also mentioned that his talk about Shri Narendra Modi 
having openly said that we had three days to do, whatever 
we coul d do and that he would not give us time after that, 
were imaginary story and that Shri Modi never told these 
things to him . 
 Shri Babu Bajangi  has stated that Shri Ashish Khetan 
had given him a script and he simply read out the same and 
that none of those facts were correct.  After going through the 
facts stated by these persons during the sting operation, it 
appears that they were bragging and that most of the facts 
stated by them are innocent.  Further, they were not 
questioned as to how and when Shri Nar endra Modi gave them 
three days time.  The facts about a gun factory owned by 
Shri Haresh Bhatt and changing the judge thrice by Shri 
Narendera Modi are unacceptable by any stretch of 
imagination inasmuch as no such gun factory could be 
unearthed by the po lice and Shri Modi was not competent 
to transfer could be unearthed by the police and Shri Modi 
was not competent to transfer the judges, as the same is 
the prerogative of the Gujarat High Court .  There are many 
factual inaccuracies in the statement of Bab u Bajrangi 
inasmuch as he has stated that there were 700 -800 dead 
bodies in Naroda Patiya and that the Commissioner of Police 
had instructed the policemen to throw it at different places in 
Ahmedabad City, as it would be difficult to explain the same.  
This is absolutely incorrect inasmuch as only 84 dead bodies 
were found at Naroda Patiya and 11 persons were reportedly 
missing.  In any case this evidence has already been adduced 
in the Court and the matter is subjudice and hence no further 
comments……”  
(emp hasis supplied)  
50.  It is indisputable that the Tehelka tape was the brainchild of 
Mr. Ashish Khaitan who was working with Tehelka.  He had 
conducted an enquiry of similar nature in the past, where the 
workers of VHP had indulged in vandalism and manhandled so me 
of the students and a professor over a painting wherein objectionable 235  
 
images of Hindu Deities were displayed.  Mr. Ashish Khaitan, in 
order to conduct a sting operation on this occasion, used a spy 
camera and also prepared an identity card in assumed na me of 
Piyush Agarwal of Delhi University.  He visited Baroda and 
conducted sting operation on Mr. Dhimant Bhatt, Chief Auditor of 
M.S. University, Baroda and office bearer of VHP.  Thereafter, from 
May to September, 2007, he recorded the audio/visual 
conve rsations of 18 individuals pertaining to post -Godhra riots.  The 
telecast of the sting operation was published on 27.10.2007 in 
television channels.  After such publication, the NHRC directed CBI 
to submit report vide order dated 5.3.2008.  The CBI in the course 
of enquiry, collected certain information and submitted report to the 
NHRC, opining regarding authenticity of the recordings in the sting 
operation and operation ‘Kalank’ delineating four points: - 
“(i) Video signals in the footage of the DVDs P -V/D -1 to P -
v/D -15 match in respect of speech, utterances, laugher, stray 
ringing tones of mobile hand sets, movements of body parts 
and body language of the persons appearing in the recorded 
events.  
(ii) No Evidence of editing, alteration and tempering has been  
detected in the audio video recordings and their respective 
voice track recorded in the DVDs, exhibits P -V/D 1 to P -V/D -
15 (ii) Cameras exhibits P -I/I and P -II/I are in working order.  
(iii) The camera characteristics of the video clips, their 
signals, frame coordinates and number of frames per second 
of the  video footage and the time lag of audio track recorded 236  
 
I the  DVD exhibits P -V/D -I to P -V/D -15 are similar to the 
camera signals, frame co -coordinators, number of frames per 
second and the time lag of audio track recordings of cameras 
P-I/I and PII/I and hence the DVDs could have been recorded 
with the camera exhibit P -I/I and the camera exhibit P -II/I.  
(iv) A large number of video clips produced in the video CDs 
exhibits P -V/C -I to P -V/C-5 have been taken from the video 
footages of DVDs exhibits PV/D -I to P -V/D -15 on the CDs. 
However, in some of the clips of CDs, the voice (audio signals) 
in the recording of DVDs have not been produced.”  
From this report, the technical veracity of the ta pe can be accepted 
on the basis of CFSL report.  However, as that would not be 
sufficient, the SIT recorded the statements of 13 persons who were 
available and had made revelations on Tehelka tape.  As aforesaid, 
only one of them has been named as offender  (No. 22) in the 
complaint filed by the appellant, namely, Babubhai alias Babu 
Bajrangi.  The material from sting operation has been submitted by 
the SIT in three (3) out of nine (9) sets of cases assigned to SIT by 
this Court, namely, in Gulberg Society, Naroda Patiya and Naroda 
Gaam, where the persons making revelations have been named as 
accused in the concerned case.  As regards the evidence from the 
stated sting operation produced by the SIT in CR No. 67/2002 
concerning Gulberg Society, the trial Court  in its judgment dated 
26.12.2013 after analyzing the same, has held that a sting operation 
can at best be a good corroborative material against the accused who 237  
 
are stung by the operation, relying on the decision of this Court in 
R.K. Anand135 and Rajat Prasad136.  We do not wish to elaborate 
further on the view taken by the trial Court in the stated case, as it 
is pending challenge.  Suffice it to mention that Mr. Babu Bajrangi 
has already been chargesheeted and tried in connection with the 
evidence  concerning sting operation in which he was stung.  The SIT 
had noted that call details of Mr. Babu Bajrangi reveal that he was 
in Ahmedabad from morning till 11:15 hrs. on 27.2.2008 and could 
not have remained present at Godhra at the time of incident.  
51.  We find force in the argument of the respondents that although 
the sting operation was not part of the complaint filed by the 
appellant or the report of the learned Amicus Curiae , but the same 
has been thoroughly investigated by the SIT including by recordin g 
statement of 13 persons who were stung.  At the end of the 
investigation, the SIT found that other persons whose statements 
were recorded by the SIT were not accused in any case and also no 
corroborative evidence pertaining to any larger conspiracy was f ound 
in their statements.  Absent such corroborative material, the 
 
135 supra at Footnote No. 85  
136 supra a t Footnote No. 8 5 238  
 
evidence in the form of sting operation can be of no avail, much less 
to take forward the allegation of larger criminal conspiracy at the 
highest echelon of the administration.  No evidence  regarding 
meeting of minds could be culled out from the statements of the 
concerned persons, much less to link the offenders named in the 
complaint of appellant.  
52.  The emphasis placed on purported extra -judicial confession of 
18 persons as recorded in Tehel ka tape, it needs to be understood 
that the extra -judicial confession can at best be used against the 
maker and not against others136A.  Further, s uch statements need 
corroboration to be used against other accused.  The SIT 
nevertheless recorded statement of 13 out of 18 persons, who had 
made revelations, as recorded in Tehelka tape.  Out of them, only 
Mr. Babu Bajrangi Patel, Member, Bajrang Dal has been named as 
an offender in the complaint submitted by appellant.  The SIT in its 
final report, h as considered the relevant aspects while dealing with 
offender No. 22 – Mr. Babu Bajrangi Patel, in the following words137:

136A see: Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872  
137 pages 365 -366 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  239  
 
 
“…..  
A-22: Shri Babu Bajrangi Patel, Member, Bajrang Dal.  
Shri Babu Bajrangi has stated that he joined Bajrang 
Dal in 1995, later got introduced to Shri Pravin Togadia, Shri 
Jaydeep Patel and Home Minister S hri Gordhan Zadafia and 
also case in contact with other Sangh Parivar activists. He has 
stated to have come to know about the Godhra carnage 
through TV news on 27 -02-2002, i n which one of the Kar -
sevaks, namely, Shri Bhimjibhai K. Patel belonging to his 
community was also killed, whereas other kar -sevaks from his 
village namely Shri Dharmendra Patel and others survived. He 
has further stated that his nephew Shri Bharat R. Pat el had 
visited Godhra on 27 -02-2002, by car on that day and returned 
to Ahmedabad in the night. He has taken the plea that mobile 
phone no. 9825020333 was used by his nephew Shri Bharat 
Patel. He has further stated that he went to Sola Civil Hospital 
on 28 -02-2002 at about 0700 hrs and the dead body of Bhimji 
K. Patel was identified by Shri Vashrambhai, uncle of Bhi mji 
Patel, taken by them to their village, and they arrived at about 
1330 hrs. The funeral of Late Bhimjibhai Patel was over at 
about 1530 hrs a nd thereafter, he has stated to have gone to 
Khedbrahma along with Shri Dharmendra Patel. He has 
further stated that he stayed at Khedbrahma on 28 -02-2002, 
as the communal riots had erupted and no transport was 
available. According to Shri Babu Bajrangi, h e returned to 
Naroda on 01 -03-2002 late in the night and was informed by 
his family members that he had been named as an accused in 
Naroda Gam and Naroda Patiya carnage cases. Thereafter, he 
has stated to have left for his elder sister Laxmiben's house on 
02-03-2002, who stays in village Kevdia -Kampa and stayed 
there for about three or four months. As per Shri Bajrangi, he 
was arrested by the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad City, on 28 -
02-2002, taken on remand for 10 days and then sent to jail. 
Subsequently, he was  released on bail on 19 -10-2002.  
He has admitted that Shri Ashish Khetan met him as 
Piyush Agarwal and informed him that he was making a film 
on Hinduism and that he has to pay a role in it and speak some 
dialogues. He has admitted his voice, and the conve rsation 
held with Shri Ashish Khetan, but has taken the plea that he 
had read the dialogues as per a written script given by Shri 
Ashish Khetan. However, he had stated that al l these facts 240  
 
were incorrect and that he had spoken the same, as Shri 
Ashish Khet an asked him to do so.  
It may be mentioned here that Shri Babu Bajrangi has already 
been charge sheeted in Naroda Patia case ( Naroda P.S.I. CR  
No. 100/2002) as well as Naroda Gam case (Naroda P.S.I. CR 
No. 98/2002) and is facing trial. In view of the fact that the 
matter is sub -judice , no action is called for in the matter……”  
53.  The SIT has not found any conspiracy, linking separate and 
disparate acts of arson and looting or outrageous claims made in 
sting oper ations or individual utterances/publications of purported 
hate speech, to any singular larger conspiracy or planned event.  The 
materials gathered during the investigation, in no way link any 
“meeting of the minds” in any of the nine (9) cases investigated  by 
the SIT or for that matter, other incidents alleged in the complaint 
or the protest petition.  The riots across the State had taken place 
spontaneously, immediately after the Godhra Train Carnage.  In the 
investigation done by the SIT in all the nine ( 9) sets of cases, no 
material was discovered pointing towards any meeting of 
minds/conspiracy in the higher echelons of the administration or 
the political establishment conspired with other persons to cause 
such riots or for having turned nelson’s eye whe n the riots had 
triggered and continued.  There is no chain or any perceivable link 
or connection in these occurrences during the relevant period, which 241  
 
ought to be the quintessence had it been a case of larger conspiracy 
at the highest level.  Indeed, the  factum of conspiracy can be 
inferred, but absent any perceivable link, much less about the 
meeting of minds of all concerned, it is not open to assume 
conspiracy in the air.  
54.  From this discussion, it is amply clear that the argument 
pressed into service on  the premise of no investigation done by SIT 
on crucial matters is contrary to the materials on record and we find 
that the opinion recorded by the SIT is after due consideration of all 
aspects  and backed by tangible materials gathered during 
investigation  by it.  
55.  For the same reason, the argument regarding mass 
mobilizations and hate speech on 27.2.2002 regarding proactive and 
aggressive behaviour of persons returning from Ayodhaya/Kar -
sevaks after the Godhra attack, is tenuous.  During the course of 
argume nts, much effort was made by the appellant to impress upon 
us that the SIT had not even bothered to record the statement of Mr. 
Anil Patel, which the respondents have duly refuted by pointing out 
from the record that there are three persons with the same n ame - 242  
 
Anil Patel and the SIT had recorded statement of all of them (Mr. Anil 
Shankerbhai Patel - VHP worker; Anil Tribhovandass Patel – a 
former Minister and named as one of the offenders in the complaint; 
and Anil M. Patel - BJP Doctor Cell) - and also an alyzed the same in 
the final report.  The appellant had referred to the statements of Dr. 
Anil M. Patel, as if he was concerned with the sting rather than 
reading the statement of Mr. Anil Shankerbhai Patel.  Similarly, 
incorrect submission was made in ref erence to Mr. Arvind Pandya, 
Advocate, who was one of the persons stung in operation ‘Kalank’.  
The appellant contended that he was appointed as a public 
prosecutor in riot cases.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Arvind H. Pandya, 
was appointed as one of the defe nding Special Counsel for Gujarat 
State in June, 2002 to defend the State Government before 
Nanavati -Shah Commission of Enquiry and he later resigned in 
October, 2008.  
56.  Be that as it may, much argument was made about the post -
mortem of dead bodies in the op en in Railway yard and also, 
parading them from Godhra to Ahmedabad.  According to the 
appellant, the post -mortem was done in the open yard as part of 
larger criminal conspiracy to obliterate the real cause of death of 243  
 
Kar -sevaks at Godhra due to fire and then to transport the dead 
bodies to Ahmedabad so as to parade them amidst shouting of 
provocative slogans so as to arouse passions.  This plea taken in the 
protest petition is of pure conjectures and surmises.  In that, the 
death s had been  caused due to t he violent act of group of persons 
(who were later identified after investigation and faced trial ending 
in conviction) for setting the train (Coach S6 of Sabarmati Express) 
carrying Kar -sevaks on fire.  The case concerning Godhra train 
episode was also in vestigated by the SIT under the supervision of 
this Court and that trial ended in conviction of 32 (thirty -two) 
persons and the confirmation appeals for capital punishment have 
also been disposed of by the High Court.  In those proceedings, the 
Courts have  considered the issue concerning post -mortem of dead 
bodies in the open in Railway yard.  In other words, the issue under 
consideration raised by the appellant has already passed the muster 
of judicial scrutiny before the trial Court and the High Court.  
Accepting the argument of the appellant on this score would need 
reinvestigation of the concluded case which must be eschewed and 
cannot be countenanced.  244  
 
57.  The allegation [No. (ii)] regarding parading of dead bodies, has 
been dealt with by the SIT with in the  following words138: - 
“…..  
ALLEGATION No.II :  
CM's decision to bring the dead bodies of victims of Godhra train 
fire incident to Ahmedabad and parade them in Ahmedabad 
City . 
 
Enquiries revealed that Smt. Jayanti Ravi, the then 
Collector & District Magistrate, Godhra Panchmahals 
District received a telephone call at about 0800 hrs from 
Shri Raju Bhargava, the then Superintendent of Police, 
Panchmahals District that there had bee n an incident of 
stone pelting as also torching of railway coach of the 
Sabarmati Express near Godhra Railway Station. 
Immediately, messages were conveyed to the concerned 
Municipal Authorities at Godhra, Lunawada and Kalol to 
send the fire tenders to the spot. According to Smt.Jayanti 
Ravi, she reached the spot near Godhra Railway Station at 
about 0845 hrs. By that time, a crowd had assembled at 
Godhra Railway Station and the immediate problem was to 
take care of the transit passengers who had been strande d 
there, because of the fire and stone pelting incident.  The 
injured passengers were given medical aid by the Civil 
Hospital, Godhra, whereas those, who had received severe 
burn injuries, were immediately admitted to the Civil 
Hospital, Godhra. Around 120 0 hrs, the District 
Administrative officials could step into the S6 coach of 
Sabarmati Express with a view to assess the actual number 
of deaths in the incident. As the bodies in the coach were 
charred and in mutilated condition, it was virtually 
impossibl e to count the head.  In order to ensure that the 
stranded passengers were not put to any further 
inconvenience, the railway authorities detached the two 
affected/burnt bogies from the main train, parked them in 
the railway yard and joined the rest of the bogies together. 
Finally, the Sabarmati Express left Godhra around 1300 
hrs for Ahmedabad, its destination.  
 
Shri Narendra Modi, Chief Minister arrived at Godhra 
by helicopter sometime between 1600 hrs to 1700 hrs and 
 
138 pages 261 -263 of original copy of the final report forming part of Co nvenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  245  
 
was accompanied by Shri Anil Mukim, th e then Secretary 
to CM. He was received at the helipad by Smt. Jayanti Ravi 
and Shri Ashok Bhatt and he straightaway drove to the 
Godhra Railway Station. CM inspected the spot and talked 
to some of the persons gathered there. Since, curfew had 
been imposed  in the Godhra town, the Chief Minister 
decided to go to Collectorate and meet the people as well as 
press. At that time Shri Gordhan Zadafia and Shri 
Prabhasinh Chauhan, the then Minister of Civil Aviation & 
Pilgrimage and being a local MLA, had also come  and they 
all went to the Collectorate Smt Jayanti Ravi has stated 
that in the meeting held at Collectorate, one Shri 
Jaydeep Patel, a VHP activist was also present.  Smt. 
Jayanti Ravi has also stated that after holding 
discussions, a unanimous decision wa s taken that the 
dead bodies, which had been identified should be 
handed over to their relatives at Godhra itself and those 
bodies whose legal heirs or guardians had not come, 
could be sent to Sola Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad since, 
they belonged to Sabarmat i Express heading towards 
Ahmedabad. Smt. Jayanti Ravi has categorically denied 
that decision was taken against her wishes. The 
decision to send the bodies to Sola Civil Hospital was 
taken in view of the fact that it was situated on the 
outskirts of Ahmeda bad City and thus away from the 
crowded area for security reasons. It has further come 
to light that out of 58 burnt and dead bodies, 4 bodies 
belonging to Dahod, Vadodara, Panchmahal and Anand 
Districts were handed over to their legal 
heirs/guardians afte r identification at Godhra itself. 
The remaining 54 dead bodies were to be sent with 
police escort to Sola Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad. 
Further, Shri Jaydeep Patel of VHP was to accompany 
them . 
 
Enquiries revealed that as per the call detail records 
of mobil e phone no. 9825023887 of Shri Jaydeep Patel, he 
reached Godhra on 27 -02-2002 around 1248 hrs and 
remained there till 2358 hrs. At Godhra, he had 
made/received calls to/from Shri Gordhan Zadafia at the 
latter's mobile phone no. 9825049145. All these calls had 
been made/received between 2003 hrs and 2113 hrs. He 
had also received calls from Shri R. J. Savani, the then DCP, 
Zone -V, Ahmedabad City from his mobile phone no. 
9825049198 between 1305 hrs and 2116 hrs. The aforesaid 246  
 
call detail records establish th at Shri Jaydeep Patel 
remained at Godhra till about 2358 hrs on 27 -02-2002.  
 
Enquiries further revealed that Shri M.L. Nalvaya, the 
then Mamaldar & Executive Magistrate issued a letter 
addressed to Dr. Jaydeep Patel of VHP, in which he had 
mentioned that 5 4 dead bodies were being sent through five 
trucks as detailed below:  
 
Sr. No.  Truck No.  No of Dead bodies 
carried  
1. GJ-17-5055  12

4. GJ-16-T-9253  12 
5. GJ-17-T-7327 
(TATA 608 
tempo)  12 
 
One Shri Hasmukh T. Patel of  Vishwa Hindu 
Parishad had acknowledged the dead  bodies . It may be 
mentioned here that the handing over of the dead bodies to 
their legal  heirs/guardians was the duty of the railway 
police, who had regist ered a case in connection with  this 
incident. Shri M. L. Nalvaya has stated that these dead 
bodies were handed over officially to  Shri Jaydeep Patel and 
Shri Hasmukh T. Patel of VHP as per the  instruction given 
by Smt.  Jayanti S. Ravi, DM and Late B. M. D amor, ADM, 
Godhra. Shri M. L. Nalvaya has filed an  affidavit before 
Nanavati Commission of Inquiry to this effect on 05 -09-
2009 .  However Smt. Jayanti Ravi has stated that no 
such instructions were given to Shri Nalvaya to hand 
over the dead bodies to Shri Jaydeep Patel or Shri 
Hasmukh T . Patel of VHP and that Shri Jaydeep Patel 
was merely to accompany the dead bodies to 
Ahmedabad . 
 
Shri Raju Bhargava, t he then Superintend ent of 
Police, Godhra has stated that since, there  was a curfew in 
the town, he had arranged  for four (4) mini trucks, Tata -
407 and  one Tata -608  tempo for the transportation of the 
aforesaid dead bodies. He also arranged for the poli ce escort  
with a pilot gypsy. Further, one Sub Inspector  was sent in 
gypsy with so me other staff and two  armed guard s each 
were made to sit in the aforesaid fiv e vehicles. The convoy 
left Godhra  around midnight intervening 27/28 -02-2002  
for Ahmedabad by road. On the way to Ahmedabad,  the 247  
 
escorts from the concerned districts had replaced each 
other. The five trucks carry ing dead  bodies reached Sola 
Civil Hospital , Ahmedabad between 0330 hrs to 0400 hrs 
on 28 -02-2002 .  At Sola Civil Hospital, Dr. Pushpa Belani, 
Medical Superintendent, P I Lathiya of Sola P. S., Shri  
Prajapati, Deputy Collector, Sh ri K. Srinivas, Collector a nd 
several other Administrative a nd Police Officers were 
present. Sh ri Jaydeep Patel handed over the letter to Shri 
Prajapati, the then Dy. Collector and the police and the 
administrative officials got busy with the preparation of  
panchnama and other docum entation. The  relatives of the 
persons, who had died in the Godhra  carnage , were also 
present in the hospital. Accordingly, 35 persons were 
identified and their dead  bodies handed over to their 
relatives by about 1300 hrs on 28 -02-2002 by the police 
after  obtaining receipts from them. It may be men tioned 
here that 25 dead bodies were claimed by the  residents of  
Ahmedabad , two (2) by the residents of Kadi, Mehsaha, five 
(5) by the residents of  Anand, two (2) by the residents of  
Khedbramha, Sabarkantha an d one  (1) from Rajkot. The 
photographs and DNA samples of the remaining 
unidentified 19 dead bodies were taken by the  hospital 
authorities. These 19 unidentified dead bodies were 
cremated on 28 -02-2002, at Gota  cremation  ground n ear 
Sola Civi l Hospi tal by the District Administrative an d Police 
officers with  the help of Surpan ch of Gota village, which is 
situated on the outskirts of  Ahmedabad city. The cremation 
was completed by about  1830 hrs on 28-02-2002.  
 
On 28 -02-2002, twelve (12) charred dea d bodies  of 
Godhra carnage were  brought to  Ramo l, Ahmed abad City 
from Sola Civil Hospital. All th ese deceased persons 
belonged to Ramol -Khokhra area.  Shri  M.K. Tandon, Jt. 
CP, Sector -II instructed Shri R. J. Savani, DCP, Zon e-V to 
make efforts to ensure that the dead bodies were m oved in 
vehicle and not by foot, as  the same would have esoalated  
the tension. It may be mention ed here that ten (10) kar -
sevaks  belon ged to  Ramol and two (2)  kar -sevaks were from 
Kho khra.  Shri R.J. Savani succe eded in  persuading the 
relatives and the we ll wishers of the deceased  to take each 
body in a vehicle and the funeral procession was g uarded 
by the police up to Hatkeshwar cremation ground,  about 4 
kms away from Ramol -Khokhra. The funeral was over by 
about 1400 hrs. and the crowd which  had gathered on the 
highway disperse d thereafter.  
 248  
 
It may thus be seen that the journey from Godhra 
to Ahmedabad started around midnight and the dead 
bodies reached Sola Civil Hospital sometime between 
0330 to 0400 hrs and there was no one on the highway 
at that point of time in the night to see them.  Further, 
though a letter had been addressed by Shri M.L. Nalvaya 
in the name of Shri Jaydeep Patel of VHP and the dead 
bodies were acknowledged by Shri Hasmukh T. Patel of 
VHP, yet the dea d bodies were escorted by the police 
upto Sola Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad situated on the 
outskirts of Ahmedabad City. At Sola Civil Hospital, 
Shri Jaydeep Patel handed over the letter to the 
hospital authorities and the local police as well as the 
hospital  authorities took charge of the dead bodies.  
Subsequently, 35 dead bodies were handed to the legal 
heirs/guardians of the deceased by the police after 
completing the formalities and documentation. The 19 
unidentified dead bodies were cremated quietly on t he 
same evening by the local administration and police 
authorities at Gota cremation ground nearby with the 
help of Sarpanch of Gota village after retaining their 
DNA samples. Subsequently, 12 dead bodies could be 
identified after conducting DNA tests, whi le the 
remaining seven (7) remained unidentified.  
 
The above facts would go to establish that though 
a letter had been addressed by Mamalatdar, Godhra to 
Shri Jaydeep Patel of VHP, yet the dead bodies were 
escorted by the police from Godhra to Ahmedabad, 
where the same were taken charge of by the hospital 
authorities, District Administrative and Police Officers 
and handed over to the kith and kin of deceased persons 
after taking proper receipt. Further, the unidentified 
bodies were disposed of b y the District Administrative 
and police officers. The fact that 25 deceased persons 
belonged to Ahmedabad, 2 to Mehsana, 1 to Rajkot and 
2 to Sabarkantha places accessible via Ahmedabad and 
the same were claimed by their legal heirs/guardians at 
Ahmedabad  justifies the decision to transport the dead 
bodies from Godhra to Ahmedabad . Shri P. C. Pande, the 
then CP,  Ahmedabad  City has stated that there had been 
no parading of dead  bodies i nasmuch as the  trucks carrying 
the dead bodies under police escort reache d Ahmedabad  
City between 0330  hrs  to 0400 hrs on 28 -02-2002, which 
means they had started fr om God hra at least three hrs 
earlier and  as such there was no one to see the m on the 249  
 
highway at  dead of the night , Shri Pande has  also stated  
that in Ah medabad City , th e dead bodies were kept in Sola 
Civil Hospital situated on  the outski rts of the City and that 
most of the dead bodies were handed over to their relations 
after  proper documentation by  28-02-2002 morning.  
 
In view of the aforesaid discussions, the alleg ation 
that CM's decision to bring the dead bodies of those 
killed in Godhra carnage to Ahmedabad was with a view 
to parade them in the City is not established. Further, 
the allegation that the dead bodies were handed over to 
Shri Jaydeep Patel, is also not  established, inasmuch as 
he only accompanied the dead bodies from Godhra to 
Ahmedabad, and that the custody of the dead bodies 
remained with the police escort and thereafter with the 
Sola Civil Hospital Authorities, Administrative and 
Police authorities. The allegation that the dead bodies 
were transported to Ahmedabad against the wishes of 
Smt. Jayanti Ravi is proved to be incorrect. Shri M.L. 
Nalvaya Mamalatdar had acted in an irresponsible 
manner by issuing a letter in the name Shri Jaydeep 
Patel in tok en of having handed over the dead bodies, 
which were case property, is being dealt with 
departmentally for this lapse ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  
While dealing with the allegation against the then Chief Minister in 
this regard, the final report has analyzed the same in the following 
words139: - 
“…..  
Despatch of dead bodies to Ahmedabad:  
The allegations as mentioned in the complaint dated 
08-06-2006 of Smt. Jakia Nasim are vague and general in 
nature As regard the specific allegation of the decision t o take 
the dead bodies of Godhra train victims to Ahmedabad, it has 
come in evidence that Shri Narendra Modi attended the 
Assembly on 27 -02-2002, when Shri Gordhan Zadafia the 
then MoS (Home) made a brief statement about the Godhra 
incident. The Chief Mini ster also informed the Assembly 
 
139 pages 337 -338 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  250  
 
that at a proposal for an ex -gratia payment of Rs. 2 lakhs 
to each victim was under consideration of the Govt. As it 
was a budget day, Chief Minister attended the Assembly 
proceedings and left for Godhra thereafter. At the G odhra 
Collectorate, after holding discussions, a unanimous 
decision was taken that the dead bodies which had been 
identified should be handed over to their relatives at 
Godhra itself and those bodies whose legal heirs or 
guardians had not come, could be se nt to Sola Civil 
Hospital. Ahmedabad, since they (deceased) were 
scheduled to travel to Ahmedabad by Sabarmati Express. 
It has further come to light that the decision to send the 
bodies to Sola Civil Hospital was taken after taking into 
account that the ho spital was situated on the outskirts 
of Ahmedabad City and thus away from the crowded area 
for security reasons.  It has also come to light that out of 58 
dead bodies 4 bodies, belonging to Dahod, Vadodara, 
Panchmahal and Anand Districts, were handed over t o their 
legal hears guardians after identification at Godhra itself. The 
remaining 54 dead bodies were spent under police escort to 
Sola Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad and Shri Jaydeep Patel of 
VHP accompanied them. Smt. Jayanti Ravi, the then 
Collector, Godhra  has categorically denied that the decision 
was taken against her wishes.  
As regards the parading of dead bodies, it has come to 
light that Shri M.L. Nalvaya, Mamlatdar, Godhra had issued 
a letter dated 27.02.2002 addressed to Shri Jaydeep Patel, in 
which  it was mentioned that 54 dead bodies as per list 
enclosed were being sent to Ahmedabad through five trucks 
whose details were given in the said letter. It has further come 
to light that trucks and escorts were arranged by SP, Godhra 
and the convoy carryin g the dead bodies left Godhra around 
midnight, reached Sola Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad between 
0330 hrs to 0400 hrs on 28.02.2002, and were taken charge 
from Shri Jaydeep Patel by the Deputy Collector in present of 
the Medical Superintendent, Police Inspect or Sola P.S., 
Collector, DCP Zone -I and several other police and 
administrative officials. It has further come to light that 
around 35 identified dead bodies were handed over to their 
relatives by about 1300 hrs on 28.02.2002. It has also 
transpired that 2 5 dead bodies were that of the persons 
belonging to Ahmedabad, 2 of Kadi -Mehsana, 5 of Anand, 2 
of Sabarkantha and 1 of Rajkot. The remaining 19 dead 
bodies remained unidentified and were cremated together on 
28.02.2002, by the Hospital, District Administr ative and 251  
 
Police Officials on the same evening after retaining their DNA 
samples in Gota cremation ground nearer to the hospital. The 
12 dead bodies belonging to Ramol and Khokhra were taken 
in vehicles and cremated at Hatkeshwar cremation 
ground ……”  
(empha sis supplied)  
The thrust of the opinion formed by the SIT upon analyzing the 
relevant materials in connection with this allegation is that the 
decision to carry the dead bodies from Godhra to Ahmedabad for 
being handed over to their relatives, was a unanim ous decision 
taken at the Godhra Collectorate.  This decision was taken as most 
of the passengers were to travel to Ahmedabad and their relatives 
had not reached or were unable to reach Godhra to collect their 
bodies.  It was also decided that bodies will be carried to Sola Civil 
Hospital located on the outskirts of Ahmedabad City and thus away 
from the crowded area for security reasons.  Most of the dead bodies 
(54 unclaimed at Godhra) were of persons who were ordinarily 
residing in and around Ahmedabad.  After the bodies were carried 
to Ahmedabad hospital under police escort, 35 bodies could be 
identified and came to be handed over to their relatives on 
28.2.2002.  The remaining 19 bodies were cremated together by 
police and the civil administration on 1.3 .2002.  Out of these 19 
dead bodies, 12 could be identified later by DNA test.  Thus, the 252  
 
entire exercise was within the control and supervision of the 
administration and there was no parading of dead bodies, as alleged.  
There was no undue haste in carryi ng the bodies including 
cremation thereof.  The essential protocol was substantially followed 
in that respect.  This opinion recorded by the SIT in its final report 
is consistent with the circumstances and materials gathered during 
the investigation.  Suff ice it to note that the allegation under 
consideration is unfounded and has been rightly discarded by the 
SIT.  
58.  The appellant had also placed emphasis on the allegations [No. 
(v)] in the complaint about the Cabinet Ministers positioning 
themselves in the Ci ty Police Control Room and issuing instructions , 
to buttress their argument about State sponsored violence, as stated 
in the affidavit filed by Mr. R.B. Sreekumar. This allegation has been 
thoroughly enquired into by the SIT and analysis of the materials 
can be discerned from pages 266 to 269140.  The sa me reads thus: - 
“…..  
ALLEGATION No.V :  
Cabinet Ministers I.K Jadeja and Ashok Bhat were 
positioned in the DGP office and Ahmedabad City Control 
Room respectively by CM . 
 
140 pages 266 -269 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  253  
 
 
During the course of enquiries into this allegation Shri 
R. B. Sreekumar has stated that either on 1st or 2nd March, 
2002, Shri K. Chakravarthi, had criticised the Govt. about the 
positioning of Shri I.K. Jadeja in the DGP's office after the 
Godhra incident and was feeling depressed, as the presence of 
Minister in his chamber had a dversely affected his supervision 
of the riot situation. He also stated to have personally seen Shri 
I.K. Jadeja, Cabinet Minister using the official telephone of the 
DGP in his chamber.  
 
Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home) has stated 
that on 28 -02.200 2, two high level meetings were called by the 
Chief Minister, one in the early morning and other late in the 
evening, which were attended by him, acting Chief Secretary, 
DGP and ADGP (Int.). In the meeting held in the morning, the 
law & order situation was  reviewed by the Chief Minister. 
According to Shri Ashok Narayan, he does not recall any 
instructions given by the Chief Minister to the DGP and CP, 
Ahmedabad that Shri Ashok Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja would 
sit in the Ahmedabad City Police Control Room, S hahibaug and 
State Control Room, Gandhinagar respectively and assist/help 
the police in their operation.  
 
However, Shri K. Chakravarthi has stated that he was 
informed by Shri Ashok Narayan that it was decided by the 
Govt., that Shri I.K. Jadeja would sit in DGP's office on 28 -02-
2002, to get information about the Law & Order situation in 
the State, as the State Control Room was located in his office. 
Shri Ashok Narayan also informed him that Shri Ashok Bhatt 
would similarly sit in the Ahmedabad City Police  Control Room 
situated in the office of the CP, Ahmedabad City. On this Shri 
K. Chakravarthi had told him that it would be better if the 
Ministers get the information through Control Room in the 
Home Department as he was bound to report all the 
information  to the Home Department. Thereupon, Shri Ashok 
Narayan informed Shri Chakravarthi that no such facility was 
available in the Home Department and therefore the  
Ministers would visit their offices. Shri Chakravarthi has 
further stated that Shri I.K. Jadeja v isited his office on 28 -02-
2002 (F.N.) and sat in his chamber for 15 -20 minutes. 
According to Shri Chakravarthi, he could not have much 
conversation with him, as he remained extremely busy with 
the telephone calls being received by him from the various 
police officers. Shri Chakravarthi thereafter asked someone to 
shift the Minister to an empty chamber in his office and this 254  
 
was done. Shri Chakravarthi was not aware as to what Shri 
Jadeja did in that room as he himself remained awfully busy 
with the telepho ne messages and follow up actions with the 
prevailing bandh situation in the State. Later, he came to know 
that Shri Jadeja had left his office. Enquiries conducted by 
Shri Chakravarthi with his Staff Officer and Officer of the State 
Control Room revealed that there was no interference from Shri 
Jadeja on the functioning of State Control Room on that day. 
Shri Chakravarthi has also stated that to the best of his 
knowledge, Shri Jadeja did not visit his office subsequently. As 
regard the positioning of Shri Ashok Bhatt in Ahmedabad City 
Control Room, Shahibaug, Shri Chakravarthi denied personal 
knowledge and stated that CP, Ahmedabad City would be in a 
better position to clarify that matter.  
 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) has claimed 
that he had attended a meeting at CM's residence at 1030 hrs 
on 28 -02-2002 along with the DGP and ADGP (Int.). After the 
meeting, he returned to his chamber on the second floor of 
Police Bhavan at about 1100 hrs and shortly thereafter went 
to meet the DGP on the first  floor of the same building.  When 
he entered DGP's chamber he found that as instructed after 
the conclusion of CM's meeting, two Cabinet Ministers of 
Gujarat, namely, Shri Ashok Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja had 
already arrived and were sitting on a sofa -set in DGP's 
chamber. He further stated that Shri G.C. Raiger the then 
Addl. DG (Int.) and Shri Maniram, the then ADO (Law & Order) 
were also present there. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt briefed the DGP and 
after taking tea, he returned to his chamber. Shortly, 
thereafte r, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt happened to go to State Control 
Room on first floor to collect some documents and saw Shri 
I.K. Jadeja and· his supporting staff sitting in the chamber of 
Dy. SP. Control Room.  Finding this a little odd, Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt went to DGP and informed him that it would be improper 
to permit outsiders in the State Control Room and asked him 
whether the Minister and his supporting staff could be shifted 
from the State Control Room. DGP agreed with his decision 
and thereafter, Shri Sanjiv Bhat t again went to Control Room 
and requested Shri I.K. Jadeja to accompany him as his 
presence in the Control Room would hamper the smooth 
functioning of the State Control Room during such a critical 
period, whereupon the latter got up and followed him. 
Acco rding to. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, he took Shri Jadeja, Minister 
to an empty chamber of Shri P. C. Thakur, the then IGP and 
requested him to make himself comfortable and contact them 
for any assistance/requirement. Shri Chaktavarthi was 255  
 
informed about it. Shri S anjiv Bhatt has also stated that 
subsequently he learnt that Shri Jadeja left the Police Bhavan 
sometime in the afternoon, after having lunch. Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt was not aware about presence of Shri Jadeja in the 
Police Bhavan on the subsequent days, but he  recollects that 
the some of the supporting staff of Shri Jadeja was seeking 
certain information from the State IB on that day and on 
subsequent two or three days.  
 
However, this version of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt is 
contradicted from the call detail records of his Govt. 
mobile phone no 9825049398, which shows that on 
28.02.2002, he remained at Ahmedabad till 1057 hrs at his 
residence and as such he could not have attended a 
meeting at CM's residence at 1030 hrs as claimed by him. 
Similarly, his claim of having s een Shri I.K. Jadeja, the 
then Minister around 1100 hrs in DGP's office is also 
falsified from the call detail recods of his mobile phone in 
asmuch as he could not have reached DGP office, 
Gandhinagar before 1130 hrs from his residence in 
Memnagar, Ahmedab ad. 
Shri I. K. Jadeja, the then Minister of Urban Housing, 
Roads & Building and Capital projects has stated that on 28 -
02-2002, Shri Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home) had 
requested him to remain present in the DGP's office in Police 
Bhavan, Gandhinagar to see that in case any information is 
received in the Control Room about any rioting incident or 
request is received for extra police force or any other issue of 
importance then the same should be passed  on the DGP, Home 
Minister etc. In view of this request, he remained present in 
the office of DGP Shri K. Chakravarthi for 3 -4 hrs for next 3/4 
days. However, he does not recollect as to what work was done 
by him, but in case some information was received about some 
incident from the party worke rs/common man, the same was 
passed on to the DGP for necessary action.  He has denied to 
have contacted/instructed any of the police officers over 
telephone installed in the office of the DGP to take action in a 
particular manner. He has categorically stat ed that he did 
not interfere with the work of the DGP or disturb the police 
officers in the discharge of their official duties. He does 
not remember to have used the telephone installed in 
DGP's office. He has also stated that the DGP had not 
shared any in formation with him and therefore, he had left 
the Police Bhavan within few minutes on subsequent 
occasions . 256  
 
 
Shri P. C. Pande, the then CP, Ahmedabad City has 
stated that it was incorrect to say that Shri Ashok Bhatt, the 
then Health Minister was stationed  at Shahibaug Control 
Room on 28 -02-2002 to guide the police force in controlling the 
Law & order situation. He has further stated that Shri George 
Fernandes, the then Union Defence Minister visited 
Ahmedabad on 0l -03-2002 and came to CP office to find out  as 
to whether Army had been deployed in the State or not.  Shri 
Fernandes reached CP's office around l000 or l030 hrs and 
asked Shri Pande about the deployment of Army, to which 
latter said that they could check up from the Control Room. 
Both of them went  to the Control Room downstairs. According 
to Shri Pande, Shri Ashok Bhatt, who had been waiting for Shri 
Fernandes in the circuit House, also came to CP's office to meet 
Shri Fernandes and entered the Control Room Shri Pande has 
also stated that Shri Fern andes and Shri Ashok Bhatt 
remained in the Control Rooh1 for about ten minutes and then 
left CP's office. According to Shri Pande, during this visit to the 
Control Room, some of the press and media persons were also 
present and as such it was somehow made to appear that Shri 
Ashok Bhatt had come to monitor the Control Room. Finally, 
Shri Pande has stated that Shri Ashok Bhatt was never 
deputed to Shahibaug Police Control Room to guide or advise 
the police.  
 
According to Shri Ashok Narayan he does not recall   
instructions given by the Chief Minister, which were conveyed 
by him either to the DGP or CP, Ahmedabad City to the effect 
that Shri Ashok Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja would sit in the 
Ahmedabad City Police Control Room, Shahibaug and State 
Control Room, G andhinagar respectively and assist/help the 
police.  
 
Late Ashok Bhatt had earlier stated that he might have 
visited Ahmedabad City Control Room for about 5 -10 minutes 
on 28 -02-2002. However, he has denied to have interfered with 
the police work, as being a  senior minister he had to maintain 
his dignity and status. Again on 01 -03-2002, he admitted to 
have visited the Shahibaug Control Room for about 10 minutes 
to meet Shri George Fernandes, who had gone to CP's office. 
The call detail records of Govt. mobile  phone no. 9825039877 
of Late Ashok Bhatt show that he returned from Godhra to 
Ahmedabad on 28 -02-2002, at about 05:16:51 hrs. Thereafter, 
the call details do not show its location till 15:50:43 hrs on 28 -
02-2002, when the location was traced to Koba Circl e, 257  
 
Gandhinagar. During this period, it is presumed that he was 
at Gandhinagar. His location on 28 -02-2002 at 16:16:37 hrs 
to 17:47:22 hrs was shown as Shahibaug Kedar Tower, 
Ahmedabad City, which would conclusively prove that during 
this period he attended  CM's press conference at Circuit House 
Annexe, Shahibaug, Ahmedabad City. Thereafter, again the 
location was seen at 17:59:22 hrs at Koba Circle, 
Gandhinagar, which shows that he was returning to 
Gandhinagar. It may thus be seen that these call details wo uld 
conclusively go to established that Late Ashok Bhatt did not 
visit Shahibaug Police Control Room on 28 -02-2002. It would 
not be out of place to mention here that the matter was more 
than seven years old, when Late Ashok Bhatt and others were 
questioned  and as such the documentary evidence is to be 
relied upon instead of depending upon the memory of the 
different individuals, who have given different versions.  
 
Shri Nissar Mohammad Malik, the then PSI, who was on 
duty in the Police Control Room, Ahmedaba d City from 28 -02-
2002 at 0800 hrs to 02 -03-2002 at 0800 hrs, has stated that 
Shri George Fernandes, the then Union Defence Minister and 
Shri Harin Pathak, the then MoS for Defence, had come to 
Police Control Room, Ahmedabad City at 1005 hrs. on 01 -03-
2002 , and left at 1025 hrs. He has confirmed that wireless 
message in this regard to be under his signatures.  He has 
denied knowledge about the visit of Late Ashok Bhatt, the then 
Health Minister to the Police Control Room either on 28 -02-
2002 or 01 -03-2002.  
 
Shri V.R. Patel, the then PSI has also denied the visit of 
Late Ashok Bhatt, the then Health Minister to the Ahmedabad 
City Police Control Room either on 28 -02-2002 or 01 -03-2002.  
 
Shri Parbatsinh A. Dholetar, the then PSI, Ahmedabad 
City Police Control Room, who was on duty on 28 -02-2002 
from 0800 hrs to 1200 hrs and 2000 hrs to 2400 hrs, has 
denied the visit of any Minister to the Police Control Room.  
 
Shri Maganbhai M. Limbachia the then PI, who was on 
duty from 0800 hrs to 2000 hrs on 01 -03-2002 in S tate Police 
Control Room, Police Bhavan Gandhinagar, has denied the 
visit of any Minister in the Control Room.  
 
It may thus be seen that Shri K. Chakravarthi has 
categorically stated that Shri I.K. Jadeja did visit his 
office, but did not go to the State C ontrol Room and he 258  
 
was made to sit in an empty chamber. Shri I.K. Jadeja 
himself has confirmed that he shifted to an empty 
chamber near DGP's chamber and that DGP did not share 
any information with him. Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then 
DGP has confirmed that  Shri Jadeja did not interfere with 
their work . 
 
Shri I. K. Jadeja has taken the plea that it is an 
established practice in Gujarat State that in case of any 
natural calamities or serious law & order situation the 
Ministers of the various departments extend their help in 
handling the crisis. No material is available to rebut his 
plea . Late Ashok Bhatt had admitted earlier that he might have 
visited Ahmedabad City Police Control Room on 28 -02-2002 
for a few minutes, but the call detail recor ds of his' official 
mobile phone show his location at Shahibaug Kedar Tower 
between 16:16:37 and 17:47:22 on 28 -02-2002, when he 
attended CM's press conference.  This was conclusively proved 
that he did not visit the Police Control Room on 28 -02-2002. 
More over, the officials of Ahmedabad City Police Control Room 
have denied that Late Ashok Bhatt ever visited the said Control 
Room either on 28 -02-2002 or 01 -03-2002. In view of the 
aforesaid position, it is established that Shri I.K, Jadeja 
did visit DGP's of fice, but did not enter the State Control 
Room or interfered with the working of the police and the 
DGP also did not share any information with him.  Further, 
it could not be established that Late Ashok Bhatt visited 
Ahmedabad City Police Control Room eith er on 28 -02-
2002 or 01 -03-2002. As per his own admission, he might 
have visited the Control Room for a few minutes on 28 -02-
2002 and/or 01 -03-2002. Therefore, the allegation that 
the two Ministers were positioned in the State Control 
Room and Ahmedabad Cit y Police Control Room by the 
Chief Minister, is not fully established  Significantly, Shri 
I.K. Jadeja remained at State Police headquarters for 2/3 hrs 
as per his own admission but did not interfere in the police 
functioning. Late Ashok Bhatt's presence in  the City Police 
headquarters on the relevant day, if any, was very negligible 
and it can not be termed of any material value. In the absence 
of documentary/oral evidence of any directions by those 
two Ministers to police officials, it can not be said at t his 
stage that they conspired in the perpetration of riots or 
took any action for controlling the riots ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  259  
 
Again, while dealing with the allegations in the complaint against the 
then Chief Minister in this regard, the final report has noted thus141: 
- 
 “…..  
Presence of two Ministers at police control room:  
It has been alleged that the CM took a decision to allow 
Shri Ashok Bhatt, the then Health Minister and Shri I. K. 
Jadeja, the then Minister of Urban Development and Urban 
Housing to sit in Ahmedabad City police Control Room and 
State Control Room respectively. Shri K . Chakravarthi, the 
then DG P, has stated during further investigation that Shri 
Ashok Narayan, ACS (Home) informed him that it was decided 
by 'the Govt. that Shri I.K. Jadeja, the then Minister would be 
in his office to secure some information about the law & order 
situation in the State, as the State Control Room is situated in 
DGP's office Shri Ashok Narayan had further informed him 
that Late Ashok Bhatt, another Minis ter, would sit in 
Ahmedabad City Police Control Room. Shri Chakravarthi has 
further stated that he had his own reservations in this matter 
and therefore, he advised the ACS (Home) that it would be 
better, if these Ministers got the information from the Con trol 
Room in the Home Department. However, Shri Ashok Narayan 
informed him that no such facility was available with him in 
the Home Department and, therefore, the two Ministers would 
come to the respective Control Rooms.  
According to Shri Chakravarthi, Shr i I. K. Jadeja, the then 
Minister came  to his office in the forenoon of 28 -02-2002 and 
sat in his chamber for about 15 -20 minutes. Shri Chakravarthi 
could not attend to him, as he was extremely busy with the 
telephone calls being received by him from all o ver the State. 
As per his recollection, he had asked someone to shift the 
Minister to an empty chamber in his office and this was done. 
He has also stated that he was not aware as to what Shri 
Jadeja did while he was in the DGP's office as he was extremely  
busy with his work on that day as rioting was taking place at 
many locations. Later, Shri Chakravarthi came to know that 
Shri Jadeja had left his office. Shri Chakravarthi has 
categorically stated that his enquiries with the staff of the State 
 
141 pages 339 -341 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  260  
 
Control Roo m had revealed that Shri Jadeja did not interfere 
with the functioning of the Control Room in any manner. ·  
Shri P. C. Pande, the then CP, Ahmedabad City, has stated 
that it was incorrect to say that Shri Ashok Bhatt, the then 
Health, Minister remained stationed at Shahibaug control 
Room on 28 -02-2002, to guide the police force in controlling 
the law & order situation. He specifically asserted that Shri 
Bhatt did not visit CP's office Control, Room on 28.02.2002. He 
has further stated that Shri George Fernandes, the then Union 
Defence Minister arrived at Ahmedabad on 28 -02-2002 night. 
Shri Fernandes reached CP's office on 01 -03-2002 around 
1000 or 1030 hrs. and asked Shri Pande about the deployment 
of Army, to which the latter said that he would check up the 
same from the Control Room. Both of them went to the Control 
Room downstairs. According to Shri Pande, Shri Ashok Bhatt 
who had been waiting for Shri Fernandes in the Circuit House, 
also came to CP's office to meet Shri Fernandes and entered 
the Control Room.   Shri Pande has also stated that Shri 
Fernandes and Shri Ashok Bhatt remained in the Control 
Room for about ten minutes and then left CP's office. According 
to Shri Pande during this to the Control Room, some of the 
press and media persons  were also present, and as such it was 
somehow made to appear that Shri Ashok Bhatt had come to 
monitor the control Room. Finally, Shri Pande has stated that 
Shri Ashok Bhatt was never deputed to Shahibaug Police 
control Room to assist the Police.  
Accordin g to Shri Ashok Narayan, he does not recall any 
instructions given by Chief Minister, which were conveyed by 
him either to the DGP or Ahmedabad City to the effect that Shri 
Ashok Bhatt and Shri I. K. Jadeja would sit in the Ahmedabad 
City police Control Ro om, Shahibaug and state Control Room, 
Gandhinagar respectively and assist/help the police.  
Shri I. K. Jadeja, the then Urban Development Minister 
has stated that it was an established norm in Gujarat State 
that in case of any natural calamities or serious law & order 
situation, the Ministers of various departments extend their 
help in handling the crisis. According to his recollection on 28 -
02-2002, he had volunteered himself, if tie could be of any help 
in the prevalent situation, to which Shri Gordhan Zad afia, the 
then MoS (Home) had told him to remain present in the Police 
Bhavan and to see that in case any information was received 
in the State Control Room about any rioting incident and any 
information was received seeking extra police force, then the 
same should be passed on to the Home Department. 261  
 
Consequent to these instructions he went to DGP's office 
around 1100 hrs. and stayed there for 2 -3 hours. He has gated 
to have interacted with the DGP and informed him that if and 
when his help was required he  could ask him. He has denied 
to have entered the State Police Control Room and has state 
that there was no question of any interference. However, Shri 
Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home) has denied to have any 
given any suggestion to Shri I.K. Jadeja. Sh ri Jadeja has 
further stated to have visited the DGP's office on the next one 
or two days also, but stayed there for few minutes only. He has 
also stated that the DGP had not shared any information with 
him and therefore, he left Police Bhavan in a few min utes on 
both these occasions.  
Late Ashok Bhatt had earlier stated that he might have 
visited Ahmedabad City Control Room for about 5 -10 minutes 
on 28 -02-2002. However, he has denied to have interfered with 
the police work, as being, a senior minister, he had to maintain 
his dignity and status. Again on 01 -03-2002, he admitted to 
have visited the Shahibaug Control Room for about 10 minutes 
to meet Shri George Fernandes, who bad gone to CP's office, 
The call detail records of mobile phone no 9825039877 of La te 
Ashok Bhatt show that he returned from Godhra to 
Ahmedabad on 28 -02-2002, at about 05:16:51 hrs. Thereafter, 
the call details do not show his location till 15:50:43 hrs. 0n 
28-02-2002, when the location was traced to Koba Circle, 
Gandhinagar. During thi s period, it is presumed that he was 
at Gandhinagar. His location on 28 -02-2002 at 16:16:37 hrs. 
17:47:22 hrs. was show as Shahibaug Kedar Tower, 
Ahmedabad City, which would conclusively prove that during 
this period he attended the CM’s press conference, at Circuit -
House Annexe, Shahibaug, Ahmedabad City. Thereafter, again 
the location was seen at 17:59:22 hrs. at Koba Circle, 
Gandhinagar, which shows that he was returning to 
Gandhinagar. These call details would go to show that he did 
not visit Shahibaug Police Control Room on 28 -02-2002.  
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) has stated that 
he had attended a meeting at the CM's residence on 28 -02-
2002 morning along with the DGP and ADGP (Int.). After the 
meeting, he returned to his chamber on the sec ond floor of 
Police Bhavan at about 1100 hrs. and shortly thereafter went 
to meet the DGP on the first floor of the same building. 
According to Shri Bhatt, when he entered DGP's chamber he 
found that as instructed after the conclusion of CM's meeting, 
two Cabinet Ministers of Gujarat, namely, Shri Ashok Bhatt 262  
 
and Shri I. K. Jadeja had already arrived and were sitting on a 
sofa -set in DGP's chamber. He further stated that Shri G.C. 
Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.) and Shri Maniram, the then 
ADG (Law & order) . were also present there. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
briefed DGP and after taking tea, he returned to his chamber 
Shortly thereafter Shri Sanjiv Bhatt happened to go to State 
Control Room on first floor to collect some documents and saw 
Shri I. K. Jadeja and his s upporting staff sitting in the chamber 
of Dy. SP, Control Room. Finding this a little odd, Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt went to DGP and informed him that it would be improper 
to permit outsiders in the State Control Room and asked him 
whether the Minister and his sup porting staff could be shifted 
from the State Control Room. DGP agreed with his decision 
and thereafter, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt again went to Control Room 
and requested Shri I.K. Jadeja to accompany him as his 
presence in the control Room would hamper the smoot h 
functioning of the state Control Room during such a critical 
period, whereupon the latter got up and followed him. 
According to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, he took Shri Jadeja, Minister 
to the chamber of Shri P.C. Thakur the then IGP, which was 
vacant at that tim e and requested him to make himself 
comfortable and contact them for any assistance/requirement. 
Shri Chakravarthi was informed about it. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has 
also stated that subsequently he learnt that Shri Jadeja left 
the Police Bhavan sometime in the afternoon, after having 
lunch Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was not aware about the presence of 
Shri Jadeja in the Police Bhavan on the subsequent days.  
During further investigation, Shri Nissar Mohammad 
Malik, the then PSI, who was on duty at the Police Control 
Room , Ahmedabad City from 28.02.2002 at 0800 hrs. to 
02.03.2002 at 0800 hrs. has stated that Shri George 
Fernandes the then Union Defence Minister and Shri Haren 
Pathak, the then MoS for Defence had come to Police Control 
Room Ahmedabad City at 1005 hrs. on 01 .03.2002, and left at 
1025 hrs.  He has confirmed the wireless message in this 
regard to be under his signatures. He has denied knowledge 
about the visit of Late Ashok Bhatt, the then Health Minister 
to the Police Control Room either on 28.02.2002 or 
01.03 .2902. Shri V.R. Patel, the then PSI on duty in the Police 
Control Room has also denied the visit of Late Ashok Bhatt, 
the then Health Minister to the Ahmedabad City. Police Control 
Room either on 28.02.2002 or 01.03.2002. Shri Parbatsinh A. 
Dholetar, the then PSI Ahmedabad City Police Control Room, 
who was on duty on 28.02.2002 from hrs. to 1200 hrs. and 263  
 
2000 hrs. to 2400 hrs. has denied the visit of any Minister to 
the Police Control Room.  
Shri Maganbhai M. Limbachia, the then Pl, who was on 
duty from 080 0 hrs. to 2000 hrs. on 01 -03-2002 in State Police 
Control Room, Police Bhavan Gandhinagar, has denied the 
visit of any Minister in the Control Room.  
In view of the aforesaid position, is established that 
Shri I. K. Jadeja did visit DGP's office, but did not go to the 
State Control Room and he was made to sit in a vacant 
chamber. Shri I. K. Jadeja himself has confirmed that he 
was shifted to a vacant ch amber near DGP'S chamber and, 
that DGP did not Share any information with him Shri. K. 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP has confirmed that Shri Jadeja 
did not interfere with their work.  
Shri I.K. Jadeja  has taken the plea that it is an 
established practice in G ujarat State that in case of any 
natural calamities or a serious law order situation, the 
Ministers of the various departments extend their help in 
handling the crisis. Late Ashok Bhatt had admitted earlier 
that he might have visited Ahmedabad City Police Control 
room on 28.02.2002 for a few minutes, but the call detail 
records of his official mobile phone show his location at 
Shahibaug Kedar Tower between 16:16:37 and 17:47:22 on 
28.02.2002, when he attended CM’s press conference, 
which would conclusively prove that he did not visit the 
Police Control Room on 28.02.2002. Moreover, the 
officials of Ahmedabad City Police Control Room have 
denied that Late Ashok Bhatt ever visited the said Control 
Room either on 28.02.2002 or 01.03.2002. It is, therefore, 
esta blished that Shri I.K. Jadeja did visit DGP’s office, but 
did not enter the State Control Room or interfere with the 
working of the police and the DGP also did not share any 
information with him. Further, it could not be established 
that late Ashok Bhatt v isited Ahmedabad City Police 
Control Room either on 28.02.2002 or 01.03.2002. As per 
his own admission, he might have visited the control 
Room for a few minutes on 28.02.2002 and/or 01.03.2002. 
Significantly, Shri I.K. Jadeja remained at State Police 
headq uarters for 213 hours as per his own admission but 
did not interfere in the police functioning. Late Ashok 
Bhatt’s presence in the City Police headquarters on the 
relevant day, if any, was very negligible and cannot be 
termed of any material value.   264  
 
Shri N arendra Modi has totally denied that such a 
decision was taken by him. He has denied any personal 
knowledge about the visit of these two Ministers to the 
respective Control Rooms. It may thus be seen that both 
the Ministers did visit the respective Control  Rooms, but 
there is no evidence to prove that they interfered with the 
law & order situation. Nor is there any evidence to indicate 
that they visited the two control rooms at the direct 
instance of Chief Minister. Since there is nothing to prove 
that thes e Ministers interfered or gave any direction in 
maintenance of law and order, no offence is made out. 
Further, in the absence of documentary/oral evidence of 
any directions by those two Ministers to police officials, it 
can not be said at this stage that t hey conspired in the 
perpetration of riots or took any action for controlling the 
riots …… ” 
(emphasis supplied)  
59.  The learned Amicus Curiae  had recorded observations in regard 
to this allegation [No. (v) ], as follows: - 
“ 
V. That 
Cabinet 
Ministers 
Shri I. K. 
Jadeja and 
Shri Ashok 
Bhatt were 
positioned in 
DGP's office 
and 
Ahmedabad 
City Control 
Room on 28 -
02-2002.  SIT concludes 
that this was a 
“Controversial 
decision” taken by 
the Govt. to place 
two ministers in 
the DGP’s offi ce 
and Ahmedabad 
City Control 
Room. However, 
SIT concludes 
that there is no 
evidence that the 
2 ministers 
passed on any 
instructions to 
the police to deal 
with riots in 
particular 
manner. 
Therefore, the 8. Th e positioning of 2 Cabinet 
Ministers having nothing to do with 
the home portfolio in the Office of 
DGP and the State Police Control 
Room respectively is another 
circumstance which reflects that 
there was a direct instruction from 
the Chief Minister. Though  Shri 
Jadeja says that he had gone to the 
DGP’s office on instructions of Shri 
Gordhan Zadafia, MoS (Home) this 
is highly unbelievable. It is obvious 
that the Chief Minister had 
positioned these 2 Ministers in 
highly sensitive places which 
should not have been done. Infact, 
these 2 Ministers could have taken 
active steps to defuse the riots, but 
they did nothing, which speaks 
volumes about the decision to let 
the riots happen. It does not appear 265  
 
allegation is only 
partially proved 
as per SIT  that these 2 Ministers immediately 
called the CM and told him about 
the situation at Gulberg and other 
places.  
9. SIT merely relied upon the 
statement of the police officers to 
conclude that these 2 Ministers did 
not give any instructions to Police 
department, but it appears highly 
unlikely that 2 cabinet Ministers of 
the Government of Gujarat would 
have not given some kind of 
directions when the CM had 
directed them to remain present.  
10. It is obvious that the 2 Ministers 
were fully aware of the developing 
situation in Gulberg Society, 
Naroda Patiya etc. In Ahmeda bad 
City. They were duty bound to 
convey the situation to the Chief 
Minister and were required to do 
everything possible to save loss of 
lives. If the stand of the CM that 
these 2 Ministers were positioned so 
as to effectively control the law and 
order sit uation is correct, then there 
would have been a far quicker 
action to control the riots in Gulberg 
Society and Naroda Patiya atleast.  
 
11. No tangible action seems to have 
been taken by the police high ups in 
the Police Department, namely 
Commissioner of P olice, to control 
the riots at Gulberg Society. 
Gulberg Society is not very far away 
from the Office of Commissioner of 
Police, Ahmedabad.”  
These observations have been dealt with by the SIT at pages 434 -
439142, being part of Annexure -1 to this judgment.  The analysis 
 
142 pages 434 -439 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  266  
 
done by the SIT after further investigation in respect of allegation 
under consideration commended to the Magistrate, as well as, the 
High Court.  We find no reason to deviate from the said opinion  or 
the view taken in that regard.  
60.  It was then urged that the phone call records produced by Mr. 
Rahul Sharma before the SIT on 2.7.2009 being CD containing tower 
details of Ahmedabad and Godhra, the efficacy thereof has not been 
reckoned in proper perspec tive.  It would reveal the nexus between 
the BJP leaders and police officers during riots.  This aspect has not 
been investigated by the SIT.  The allegation No. (xxiii) culled out by 
the SIT in this regard has been analyzed at pages 310 -312143 and 
again in  reference to the observations made by the learned Amicus 
Curiae , at page 456144.  The SIT, after investigation, eventually 
opined that the CDs collected by Mr. Rahul Sharma from M/s. 
Cellforce were copied by him on his personal computer kept at home 
and operated multiple times; and was unable to produce the original 
received from the original source (cell company).  Further, when the 
SIT wanted to verify the mobile phones of suspected/accused

144 page 456 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  267  
 
persons, the cell companies informed that the data was not 
reta ined/available due to efflux of time.  The SIT analyzed all the 
aspects in respect of this allegation as follows145: - 
“…..  
ALLEGATION No. XXIII:  
The CD regarding telephone calls by BJP leaders and 
police officers during riots was not probed into by the 
Investigating Officers of the Naroda -Patiya and Gulberg 
Society cases. The CD was produced by Rahul Sharma, 
SP, CBI before the Nanavati Commission.  
Enquiries revealed that Shri Rahul Sharma was posted 
as DCP, Control Room, Ahmedabad City on 08.04.2002. On 
07.05.2002, Shri Rahul Sharma had been instructed by the 
then Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City, Shri P.C. 
Pande to report to the Crime Branch, Ahmedabad City and 
assist the then Additional CP, Crime Branch, Shri A.K. 
Surolia in the investigation of ser ious riot -related offences. 
Shri Rahul Sharma was also informed by Shri P.C. Pande 
that there would be no formal written order in this regard. 
Accordingly, Shri Sharma reported to Shri Surolia on the 
same afternoon.  As a matter of prudence, he decided to 
collect scientific evidence in support of the investigation that 
was undergoing.  Shri Rahul Sharma has stated that he had 
information about the use of mobile phones in a big way in 
the alleged riots throughout the State including Ahmedabad 
City. According ly, he drafted à letter calling for data from two 
mobile phone service providers provider's ‘Cellforce’ (now 
Vodafone) and ‘AT&T’ (now Idea). The letters were issued 
under the signature of the then ACP, Crime Branch, Shri.S.S. 
Chudasama, who was also inves tigating the two serious 
cases of massacres at Naroda Patiya and Gulberg Society. 
According to Shri Rahul Sharma the information asked for, 
was the telephone directory of the two mobile phone 
companies, calling time called/calling number, location of 
the m obile phone when they were calling/receiving the calls, 
etc, for the period from 25.02.2002 to 04.03.2002 in respect 
of all mobile phones operating from Ahmedabad city area.  
Shri Rahul Sharma has further stated that the idea behind 
 
145 pages 310 -312 of  original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  268  
 
the collection of this data was, amongst others, to establish 
the location of the alleged perpetrators of crime and their 
accomplices at the time of commission of the offence. 
Further, it was also required to prove the contact established 
between the different accused persons as  also with ‘erring’ 
policemen, bureaucrats and politicians.  
In response to the letter sent by Shri Chudasama, data 
was sent in the correct format by ‘AT&T’ within a week on a 
CDR.  Shri Rahul Sharma has further stated that he had 
personally gone to collec t the said information from AT&T 
from their office in Suman Towers in Gandhinagar. The data 
provided by AT&T was in the “TEXT” format and had all the 
relevant information that had been asked for . Shri Rahul 
Sharma copied out the data on his computer kept a t his 
home and the CD was returned to Shri Chudasma. This 
copying was required to be done, if the data from the two 
mobile phone companies were to be analysed together . 
Shri Rahul Sharma has further stated that the data from the 
‘Celforce’ was sent quite late and by that time probably Shri 
A. K. Surolia had been sent on deputation to BSF and Shri 
P.P. Pandey taken over as the Joint CP, Crime Branch. As per 
the recollect ion of Shri Rahul Sharma, the information 
from the AT&T had come, while Shri Surolia was in -
charge of the Crime Branch, but the information from 
‘Celforce’ had not come during Shri Surolia's tenure  
According to Shri Rahul Sharma, the information from 
the ‘Celforce’ came during Shri Pandey's tenure as the 
Joint CP, Crime Branch, Ahmedabad City Police, but the 
data was sent as an MS Access database. Since, Shri 
Rahul Sharma had no knowledge of MS Access; he took 
the assistance of PSI Shri K.J. Chandana, who was in the 
computer section of Ahmedabad Police 
Commissionerate. Shri Rahul Sharma has further stated 
that Shri Chandana used to open the files before him in 
the computer kept in his office. Initially, the data sent 
was not as had been requested for and th e correct data 
could be obtained only after several attempts . On all these 
occasions, it was Shri Chandana who usually went to the 
office of the ‘Celforce’ to get the correct data.  
As per Rahul Sharma, the final CDR containing the 
data was not received thr ough Shri Chandana, but was 
forwarded to him by Shri P.P. Pandey through a DO Letter 
written in Gujarati. In the DO letter, he had mentioned that 
the CDs had been prepared under his (Rahul Sharma's) 269  
 
instructions and that he alone should analyse the data. S hri 
Rahul Sharma has further stated that ‘Celforce’ had also 
furnished data in respect of mobile phones operating from 
Godhra though the same had not been called for. According 
to Shri Rahul Sharma, after a few days of the receipt of this 
letter, he was tr ansferred out and posted as the 
Commandant, SRPF, Group XI, Vav, District Surat. Shri 
Rahul Sharma does not remember, whether the CDs sent 
by ‘Celforce’ were two in number or one in number, but 
given the volume of data received from Celforce, he 
believes t hat there should have been two CDs. Shri Rahul 
Sharma has further stated that he had no knowledge of 
MS Access at that particular point of time, due to which 
he could not analyse or interpret the contents of the CDs. 
However, he has admitted to have copied  the contents of 
the CD(s) sent by ‘Celforce’ onto the hard disk of his 
personal computer kept at home . 
Shri Rahul Sharma has further stated that after he 
received his transfer orders in the first week of July, 2002, he 
instructed, Shri Chandana, PSI to de liver the original CD(S) 
personally to Shri P.P. Pandey. As per Shri Rahul. Sharma, 
Shri Chandana, PSI visited the Jt. CP's office a couple of 
times, but did not find Shri Pandey and, therefore, he came 
back with the CD(s). During this period the CD(s) rem ained 
in the possession of Shri Chandana. Shri Rahul Sharma has 
also stated that on probably the second last day of his tenure 
as the DCP, Control Room, he had called a Rider from Control 
Room, took the CD(s) from Shri Chandana and directed the 
‘Rider’ to hand over the CD(s) to Shri P.P. Pandey Further, 
according to Shri Rahul Sharma, the ‘Rider’ handed over 
the CD(s) to Shri Pandey and reported this fact to him. 
Shri Rahul Sharma is not in a position to identify the 
‘Rider’ after so many years. He has also  stated that at 
that particular time, his PA was on leave on account of 
his son's marriage and, therefore, he could not the CD(s) 
through a formal letter .  
Shri Rahul. Sharma has reiterated that he never 
analysed the information contained in the CDs while 
posted as DCP, control Room and learnt basic MS Access 
only in 2004 after he joined the CBI on deputation.  He 
has also stated that it was a practice in Gujarat Police to keep 
a copy of Case Diaries and other important documents of 
cases that had been inves tigated/Supervised by an officer. 
Consistent with this practice, he wanted to keep a copy of the 270  
 
CD(s) data that had been copied onto his home computer's 
hard disk. He also wanted to have the data on one CD for 
compactness. He had, therefore, consulted Shr i Chandana is 
this regard and who in turn had advised him ‘zip’ the files, so 
that they would be compressed. He did accordingly and 
data from the CDs sent by ‘AT&T’ and ‘Celforce’ was 
copied on single CD, which he retained. He burnt the 
information on the CD Writer installed onto his computer 
himself . 
Shri Rahul Sharma has also stated that he submitted 
copies of the same CD(s) containing the zipped data to the 
Nanavati -Shah Commission of Inquiry (two copies) on 30 -10-
2004, at the time of his deposition/cros s examination and to 
the Banerjee Committee (one copy) on 22 -11-2004 at the time 
of his examination. The original CD first prepared by him was 
handed over to the SIT constituted by the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of India. Immediately after these CD(s) were hand ed 
over to Nanavati -Shah Commission of inquiry and also to the 
Banerjee Committee, it was widely reported in the print as 
well as electronic media that Shri Rahul Sharma has 
produced copy of the CD(s) before the commission as well as 
Committee.  
Shri Tarun Barot, the then Police Inspector, Crime 
Branch Ahmedabad City and now ACP, Special Operation 
Group, Ahmedabad has stated that he was entrusted with 
the investigation of Naroda P.S. cr n o. I98/02 relating to the 
death of 11 Muslims killed in 2002 riots and that he had 
investigated this case from 19 -05-2002 to 30 -05-2002 and 
subsequently with effect from 30 -11-2002 to 10 -04-2008.  
Shri Barot has further stated that during the course of 
investigation, he had made an attempt to collect the call 
detail records o f mobile phones of suspected/accused 
persons, but the Cell companies informed that the data was 
not available. However, he did not approach Shri Rahul 
Sharma to get the call details as he did not know that the 
latter was in the possession of the call detai ls of all the 
numbers operating from Ahmedabad City during the riots 
period and no one had told him about it. According to Shri 
Barot, he did not know whether Shri Rahul Sharma, SP had 
handed over a copy of the CDs to Nanavati -Shah Commission 
of Inquiry or  Banerjee Committee appointed by the Railways 
to enquire into the Godhra incident. Shri Barot has also 
stated that a news item had appeared in an English daily 
regarding the mobile phone details of Maya Kodnani and 271  
 
Jaydeep Patel and on the basis of the sai d news item, both of 
them were summoned and interrogated about their location 
on 28 -02-2002 and thereafter. Both Mayaben Kodnani and 
Jaydeep Patel informed that they were present at Sola Civil 
Hospital. Shri Mayaben Kodnani confirmed that her mobile 
phone remained in her possession, whereas Jaydeep Patel 
claimed that his mobile was left in his car, which was taken 
away by his driver. Shri Barot has also stated that efforts 
were made to get their call details from the mobile service 
providers, but the same w ere not provided and as such the 
call details could not be obtained, analysed and cross 
checked. The plea put forward by Shri Barot is not 
convincing inasmuch as the news about the production 
of the CDs containing call detail records of mobile phones 
at Ah medabad City by Shri Rahul Sharma before the 
Commission had appeared in almost all the newspapers 
and therefore it is difficult to believe that Shri Barot did 
not come to know about it.  
Shri GL. Singhal, SP, ATS, who remained the IO of 
Gulberg Society case  and Naroda Patiya case, has stated that 
he did not investigate into the call details records of the 
mobile phones as well as landline details of the accused 
persons or any other person connected with these cases. He 
has admitted that he came to know about  the production of 
the CDs containing the call details of the various calls 
made/received from the mobile phones Ahmedabad City by 
Shri Rahul Sharma before the Nanavati -Shah Commission of 
Inquiry and Banerjee Committee, but did not approach him 
to get the copies of CDs containing the CDRs of mobile 
phones. He has further admitted that he did not approach 
the cell phone service providers to get the call detail records 
of the cell phones operating from Ahmedabad City from 27 -
02-2002 onwards. He has stated to have interrogated Dr. 
Mayaben Kodnani, MLA and Jaydeep Patel, a VHP activist in 
Naroda Patiya case about their locations on 28 -02-2002, but 
they had denied their presence on the spot at the time of 
incident. He has also stated that he could not confront th em 
with their call details, as the same were not available with 
him.  
 
This appears to be an intentional lapse on the part of Shri 
Tarn Barot, the then P I and now ACP, SOG, Ahmedabad and 
Shri G.L. Singhal, the then ACP, Crime Branch and now SP, 
ATS, Ahmedab ad and the same deserves to be dealt with 272  
 
major penalty departmental proceedings against them. 
However, no criminal offence is made out against them……”  
(emphasis supplied)  
In other words, the SIT due to lapse of time, was not in a position to 
verify the authenticity of the CDs regarding telephone calls produced 
by Mr. Rahul Sharma and in any case, the call history by itself would 
not have been sufficient to suspect commissio n of any offence, much 
less of hatching larger criminal conspiracy, which was required to 
be investigated by the SIT.  The opinion formed by the SIT on the 
basis of available materials collected during investigation 
commended to the Magistrate, as well as,  the High Court.  That view 
needs no departure.  
61.  In other words, there is no merit in the argument of the 
appellant that the SIT had failed to collect the call records of the 
accused persons, not analyzed the available call records from CD 
supplied by Mr. Rahul Sharma and failed to seize the phones of 
persons involved.  In that, the events had unfolded in the year 2002 
and the SIT was constituted only in the year 2008 by this Court to 
look into and enquire into the complaint of appellant, dated 
8.6.2006.  D uring the contemporary period (year 2002), two mobile 
operators were providing services in the Gujarat State, namely, M/s. 273  
 
AT&T and M/s. Cellforce, who had the protocol of maintaining the 
electronic call records for one year only146.  This fact has been not ed 
in the statement of Mr. Viraf Fanibanda – Head Legal Advisor, Idea 
Cellular and of Mr. Dhiren Jayantilal Laria – Legal department, 
Vodafone, recorded by SIT on 28.11.2008.  These statements, 
though crucial, have not been adverted to by the appellant.  
Resultantly, it was not possible for the SIT to retrieve the call records 
from these service providers after its appointment in the year 2008.  
It is, therefore, not a case of failure of the SIT to collect the call detail 
records of various persons referred  to in the details discernible from 
the record submitted by Mr. Rahul Sharma.   
62.  Insofar as the CD record submitted by Mr. Rahul Sharma, as 
aforesaid, he had failed to handover the case property to the 
investigating officer (of Naroda police station), deali ng with the 
concerned case nor got it entered in the register of case property 
(Muddamal) or informed the Court of jurisdiction about seizure of 
 
146 ‘License Agreement for Provision of Unified Access Services’ provide as under:  
“The LICENSEE shall maintain all commercial records with regard to the 
communica tions exchanged on the network.  Such records shall be 
archived for at least one year for scrutiny by the Licensor for security 
reasons and may be destroyed thereafter unless directed otherwise by 
the licensor.”  274  
 
such case property.  He had instead produced the CD on 31.5.2008, 
which came to be seized by the investigating officer and taken as 
evidence.  These two CDs were collected by the investigating officer 
from the records of Nanavati -Shah Commission of Enquiry.  Mr. 
Rahul Sharma had submitted the same before the Commission.  
Additionally, one CD containing the same inf ormation was 
submitted by Mr. Amresh Bhai N. Patel, Jansangharsh Manch, 
which was obtained by him from the Commission of Enquiry.  That 
was also produced before the investigating officer.  In absence of the 
original CDs which were never produced by Mr. Rah ul Sharma, it 
was not possible for the SIT to obtain the certificate of authenticity 
under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and at the same 
time, it had been noticed that the CDs were copied by Mr. Rahul 
Sharma in his computer and format change d, by changing it in 
Zipped format.  The SIT has analyzed all these aspects and opined 
that MD 5 Hash value of the files in all the three CDs was found same.  
Further, the files containing call detail records or fragments of the 
files could not be found on the computer storage media.  Moreover, 
due to lapse of time, no fruitful purpose would have been served in 
seizing the mobile phone of the concerned user after seven years to 275  
 
undertake roving enquiry.  All these aspects have been duly 
considered by the SIT  while dealing with allegation No. (xxiii) as 
reproduced hitherto, in paragraph No. 60.  The opinion so recorded 
by the SIT commended to the Magistrate, as well as, the High Court.  
We find no reason to deviate therefrom.  
63.  Needless to underscore that every information coming to the 
investigating agency must be regarded as relevant.  However, the 
investigating agency is expected to make enquiries regarding the 
authenticity of such information and after doing so must collect 
corroborative evidence in support t hereof.  In absence of 
corroborative evidence, it would be merely a case of suspicion and 
not pass the muster of grave suspicion, which is the pre -requisite 
for sending the suspect for trial.  This is the mandate in Section 
173(2)(i)(d) of the Code, which postulates that the investigating 
officer in his report must indicate whether any offence appears to 
have been committed and if so, by whom.  The opinion of the 
investigating officer fo rmed on the basis of materials collected during 
the investigation/enquiry must be given due weightage.  That would 
only be the threshold, to facilitate the concerned Court to take 
cognizance of the crime and then frame charge if it is of the opinion 276  
 
that t here is ground for presuming that the accused has committed 
an offence triable under Chapter XIX of the Code.  
64.  The appellant had also alleged about police inaction which 
facilitated riots as part of conspiracy giving specific instances in that 
regard.  The SIT has considered this allegation being allegation No. 
(xxv)147, and upon analyzing the materials gathered during the 
investigation, opined that the circumstances highlighted by the 
appellant were not sufficient link to infer that the named persons 
had hat ched larger conspiracy to cause mass violence across the 
State targeting the minority community.  On closer scrutiny of the 
analysis in this regard, the opinion of the SIT is a plausible opinion.  
For, the instances adverted to are essentially matters conc erning the 
acts of commission and omission at the ground level and not 
indicative of any link to sustain the allegations of larger criminal 
conspiracy.  As noted earlier, the erring officials identified for their 
acts of commission and omission at the grou nd/local level have been 
proceeded with departmentally.  Every act of commission and 
omission would not result in hatching criminal conspiracy unless 
 
147 pages 320 -325 of original copy of the fina l report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  277  
 
the acts have been done deliberately and there is meeting of minds 
of all concerned.   
65.  Similarly, the alle gation that victims of riots and police firings 
was predominantly of the Muslim community, has been dealt with 
as allegation No. (xxx)148, while noting that the incident referred to 
unfolded on 28.2.2002, wherein 17 persons were killed in police 
firing in A hmedabad City, which included 11 Hindus and 6 
belonging to minority community.  Further, police firing was 
required because of the evolving situation and out of compulsion to 
control the situation.   This is observed at page 329 as follows: - 
“….. During  enquiries, Shri P.C. Pande, formerly CP, 
Ahmedabad City has stated that during the riots, it is difficult  
for the police to identify as to whether any individual belongs to 
a particular community.  He has further stated that on 28 -02-
2002, 17 persons were ki lled in police firing in Ahmedabad City, 
which included 11 Hindus and 6 Muslims, which would go to 
show that there was no discrimination on the part of police.  He 
has also stated that in the succeeding days, the retaliation 
started from the Muslim side al so and therefore, wherever force 
was used by the police casualties resulted on both the sides .  
According to Shri Pande, it is incorrect to say that the 
administration and police were moving in collaboration with the 
rioters and were targeting the persons from the minority 
community with an intention to achieve the alleged objective of 
CM.  In view of the aforesaid position, the allegation is not 
established ……”  
 
148 page 329 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  278  
 
66.  Even the allegation regarding nepotism practiced in postings, 
transfers, promotions etc. facilitating the ongoing subversion of the 
criminal justice system has been rightly discarded as vague and 
without any specific instances.  That allegation is noted in  paragraph 
85 of the complaint dated 8.6.2006.   
67.  Be it noted that the SIT was constituted by this Court to 
investigate into the allegations providing specific inputs/information 
indicative of commission of offence of larger criminal conspiracy and 
involvem ent of concerned person in executing such crime.  The SIT 
was not there to generally enquire into administrative matters of the 
State, such as posting, transfers and promotions unless specific 
input is set forth or was to be brought to the notice of the SI T.   
68.  Suffice it to note that absent clear and direct material indicative 
of involvement of named person(s) in hatching criminal conspiracy 
to cause mass violence across the State targeting minority 
community during the relevant period, the attempt of the a ppellant, 
if we may say so, is bordering on sewing of insignificant unconnected 
circumstances  and events  regarding the failure s and in some cases, 
laxity in  administration , which is being projected  as an act of 279  
 
concerted effort of all the State officials u pto the highest level without 
there being any tittle of material to show that there was meeting of 
minds of all these persons at some level.  
69.  The appellant had gone to the extent of attributing motives in 
relation to transfer of officers from field executiv e in the thick of riots 
despite the objections of concerned DGP.  In place of such able 
officers, posting was done of officials who were willing to subvert the 
system for political and electoral benefits.  This allegation has been 
duly enquired into by the  SIT being allegation No. (vi) and dealt with 
in the following words149: - 
“…..  
ALLEGATION NO. VI : 
Officers from field executive posts were transferred (by 
CM), in the thick of riots in 2002, despite DGP's objection 
so as to facilitate placement of those who were willing to 
subvert the system for political and electoral benefits as 
narrated in Para 67 of the complaint dated 08.06.2006, 
wherein instances of punishment, ill -treatment etc. are 
listed in respect of the following officers: (1) Shri Rahul 
Sharma, IPS, (2) Shri Vivek Shrivastava, IPS, (3) Shri 
Himanshu Bhatt, IPS, (4) Shri M.D. Antani, IPS, (4) Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar, IPS and (6) Shri Satishchandra Verma, 
IPS.  
This allegation relates to instances relating to 
punishment, ill -treatment etc. to th e various  police officers, 
who  were transferred from the field executive posts in the thick 
of riots in 2002  so as to facilitate the placement of those, who 
 
149 pages 269 -271 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenienc e Compilation of  respondent No. 2  280  
 
were willing to subvert the system for political and  electoral 
benefits . 
Shri Rahul Sharma, who had  been posted as SP, 
Bhavnagar on 16 -02-2002, has stated  that on 27 -02-2002, he 
was on leave and after having come to know about the Godhra 
train  carnage, rushed to Bhavnagar and reached there in the 
evening of 27 -02-2002. He has f urther  stated that on 01-03-
2002, permission was granted to Sadhu -Samaj by District 
Administration to  take out a procession and after the rally 
started at 1710 hrs, the riot broke out in Bhavnagar City  and 
the mob had started gathering at different places in Bhavnagar 
City. Fur ther, one Kishor  Bhatt, President of Shiv -Sena, 
Bhavnagar Branch was arrested by the police and thereafter, 
some  reports of stone pelting, arson and rioting had come in 
and curfew was imposed by the District  Collector at his 
request. He has also stated tha t Bhavnagar police had 
succeeded in controlling  the communal riots by the evening of 
02-03-2002. Shri Rahul Sharma has stated that Shri  Gordhan 
Zadafia spoke to him over phone on 16 -03-2002 and informed 
him that he had done a  good job in controlling the co mmunal 
riots, but the ratio of deaths, as a result of police firing in  the 
riots was not proper, i.e., more number of deaths of Hindus 
than Muslims. Shri Rahul Sharma  has also stated that on 23 -
03-2002, a mosque was attacked by a riotous mob following 
whic h 21  persons were arrested and that he was pressurised 
by the local leaders to release the m, to which  he did not agree. 
As a result, of he had difference of opinion with the Collector, 
IGP , Junagadh  Range and DGP. Shri Rahul Sharma was 
transferred as DCP, Control Room, Ahmedabad City  and he 
was relieved from the charge of post of  SP, Bhavnagar from 26 -
03-2002. However, Shri  Rahul Sharma has stated that he 
would not be able to comment on the circumstances that led 
to his transfer from Bhavnagar to Ahmedabad City as 
transfer/posting is the prerogative of the  Govt.    
Shri Vivek Srivastava has stated that he remained 
posted as SP , Kutch during January , 2001 to March, 2002. He 
has further stated that as a mark of protest against the Godhra 
carnage,  VHP had given a call for Gujarat Bandh and had 
taken out a rally in Bhuj town on 28 -02-2002,  for which 
adequate arrangements had been made, as a result of which 
there was no untoward  incident in the entire District and no 
killings were reported from anywhere in the Dist rict.   According 
to Shri Vivek Srivastava, a few days after the Godhra incident, 
a Muslim family had  been assaulted with sharp edged weapons 281  
 
at a Dargah out  side Nakhatrana town by some  unknown 
miscreants, causing injury to two persons. Further, according 
to Shri Vivek Srivastava,  a case u/s 307 IPC was registered 
and one Home -Guard Commandant with BJP leanings of  
Kutch District had been arrested and charge sheeted on 
completion of investigation. Shri Vivek  Srivastava has also 
stated that he got a few phone  calls from the office of Home 
Minister and  Chief Minister asking him about the details of the 
case and also as to whether there was adequate  evidence 
against all the accused to which he confirmed that sufficient 
evidence was available  against all the accu sed persons for 
effecting their arrest. Shri Vivek Srivastava was tr ansferred in  
the last week of March, 2002 and posted as Deputy 
Commissioner , Prohibition & Excise,  Ahmedabad Zone. 
However, Shri Vivek Srivastava was unwilling to comment 
upon the reasons,  as according to him, transfers were the 
prerogative of the Govt.  
Shri M.D. Antani, who remained posted as SP, Bharuch 
during 10 -08-2000 to 26 -03-2002, has stated that keeping in 
view that Baruch was a communally sensitive District with  
27% Muslim population, adequate police arrangements were 
made pursuant to the Godhra  carnage incident. According to 
Shri Antani, from 28 -02-2002 onwards, incidents were 
reported  only in respect of Bharuch town, Ankleshwar and Raj -
Pardi areas, whereas Palej, Amod , Kav i, Vedach, Nabipur, 
Hansot and Bharuch Talukas were almost ventless. In all two 
Muslims had  died during the riots, whereas three Muslims 
were killed in police firing on 19 -03-2002. He was  transferred 
on 26 -03-2002, as SP, Narmada and was relieved on the sa me 
day. However, Shri  Antani has stated that he can not comment 
on the allegation of any motive for his transfer.  
Shri Satish Chandra Verma was posted as DIG, Border 
Range with headquarters at  Kutch -Bhuj during the period 
2003 -2005, which has three Distric ts including Patan. At that 
time  one Shri Shankar Chaudhary was the sitting MLA of BJP 
from Radhanpur Assembly  constituency. Shri Verma has 
stated that a criminal case had been registered in Radhanpur 
P.S.  in the context of rioting between Hindu and Muslim  
crowds after the Godhra carnage on 27 -02-2002, in which two 
Muslims had reportedly died due to police firing.  However, it 
was brought to  his notice that the death of these two Muslims 
by police firing was n ot substantiated by available  evidence 
and instea d evidence was available against private individuals 
including Shri Shankar  Chaudhary, MLA for committing acts, 282  
 
which led to the death of these persons. Shri S. C. Verma  has 
further stated that he had issued a formal order for the arrest 
of Shri Shankar Ch audhary,  MLA for murder and attempt to 
murder. Shri Verma has also stated that sometime later, he 
was  transferred as Principal State Reserve Police Training 
Centre, Chawky, Junagadh, However, Shri  Verma has stated 
that he can not say that this transfer was  a consequence of 
this aforesaid order.  He has also stated that he can not call the 
post of Principal of a training institution unimportant.  Shri 
Verma has further clarified that the scrutiny of the evidence by 
him in the aforesaid criminal  case was not a part of scrutiny of 
2000 odd cases entrusted to the DGP by the Hon'ble Supreme  
Court of India. Shri Verma has further stated that it was not 
true that the post of Principal,  SRRTC had been upgraded from 
SP to DIG to post him there and that this post had be en 
encadred before his posting there as a DIG level post.  
Shri. R. B. Sreekumar has stated before the SIT that he 
remained posted as Addl. DG  (Int.) during 09 -04-2002 to 18 -
09-2002 He has further stated that during this period, he had 
sent  reports against Sangh -Pariwar supporters, about the 
prejudice of the Govt officials against the  Muslims and the 
general subversion of the Criminal Justice System, to the Govt . 
and DGP. He  has further stated that in his first affida vit filed 
before Nanavati -Shah Commission  of inquiry, he  had pointed 
out that the State IB had informed the State Govt. about the 
likely repercussions of  Godhra incident and measures to be 
initiated by the field officers, but on account of pressure  from 
the ruling party and some higher officers, no st eps were taken 
to control the emerging  communal situation as detailed in 
Gujarat police Manual and that this paved the way for the  
violence from the Hindu mob against the Muslims. He had also 
stated in his affidavit that the  imposition of curfew was d elayed 
on 28 -02-2002, till 1300 & 1400 hrs in Ahmedabad City to  
facilitate the parading of dead bodies of Godhra victims. Shri 
R. B. Sreekumar had also  submitted his second affida vit on 
06-10-2004, covering the additional terms of Nanavati -Shah  
Commission,  in which he had pointed out the subversion of 
criminal justice system against the  Muslims and specific 
suggestions to remedy the situation, but the Govt. did not take 
follow up  action on the suggestions made by him in his 
assessment reports dated 24 -04-2002, 15 -06-2002,  20-08-
2002 & 28 -08-2002. Shri R. B. Sreekumar has further stated 
that he had filed a third  affidavit on 09 -04-2005, presenting 
the data on his harassment and victimization on account of  his 
non compliance of intimidator briefing by Sta te Home 283  
 
Department official, who had asked  him to look after the 
political interests of the Govt. Shri R. B. Sreekumar has also 
stated that  after a charge sheet was served upon him on 06 -
09-2005, questioning his revelations before the  Nanavati 
Commission, he filed a fourth affidavit before the Nanavati 
Commission on 27 -10-2005. Shri R.B. Sreekumar has further 
contended that he was superseded in promotion be cause  of the 
aforesaid acts and thus victimized by the Govt. He has also 
stated that he had been  exone rated of all nine charges served 
upon him by the Central Administrative Tribunal,   Ahmedabad 
on 28 -09-2007 and that the State Govt., sought a stay on the 
operation of the CAT's  order from Gujarat High Court, which 
was rejected and that the Hon ’ble High Cou rt had ordered  for 
the expeditious release of regular pension to him and also 
grant of promotion from the date of  his supersession i.e. 23 -
02-2005. The State Govt. had complied with the High Court 
directive  and issued orders on 02 -05-2008 . 
The statements o f Shri Rahul Sharma, the then SP, 
Bhavnagar, Shri Vivek Srivastava, the  then SP, Kutch, Shri M. 
D. Antani, the then SP, Bharuch and Shri S. C. Verma, the 
then DIG,  Border Range, Kutchch -Bhuj before the SIT would 
go to show that though their transfers were  immediately after 
certain events in their jurisdiction, yet according to them 
postings/transfers  being the prerogative of the Govt., the same 
can not be linked to certain events that took place  immediately 
before their transfers. Shri S. C. Verma has point ed out that 
the post of Principal of  a training institution could not be said 
to be unimportant. He has further clarified that the  scrutiny of 
the allegation in a murder case of two Muslims was not a part 
of scrutiny of 2000 odd  cases entrusted to the DGP by the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. Shri Verma has also clarified  
that the post of Principal , SRPTC  had been upgraded before his 
posting there.  
The testimony of Shri R .B. Sreekumar is motivated 
inasmuch as he had started collecting  data/evidence during 
posting as Addl. DG (Int.). Even subsequently, he clandestinely 
recorded  his conversation with Shri G.C. Murmu, Home 
Secretary and Shri Arvind Pandya, Govt . Advocate before the 
Commission with a view to level the allegation of pressure 
tactics against  him.  He had also recorded his conversation with 
Shri Dinesh Kapadia, an under Secretary,  Budget and Co -
ordination in the Ho me Department to be utilized 
subsequently, as evidence  against the Govt. Surprisingly, he 
kept all these things a well guarded secret till he was  284  
 
superseded in promotion in February, 2005 and made it public 
in his third affidavit filed before  the Commission on 09 -04-
2005. All these actions on the part of Shri R.B. Sreekumar 
therefore,  appear to be motivated. In view of this, the c redibility 
of his oral testimony has also been  considerably reduced 
because the same stands un corroborated. On account of the 
aforesaid  factors, this allegation therefore, is not 
established ……”  
70.  Concededly, the act of transfer/posting of officials has been 
after the unfolding of mass violence across the State.  It was 
obviously an administrative matter to address the expediencies of 
that situation.  We fail to understand as to how this circumstance 
can be reckoned as hatching of criminal conspiracy resulting  into 
mass scale violence across the State  aftermath Godhra incident .  
Such conspiracy ought to have preceded the triggering of mass 
violence.  Be that as it may, the SIT has done everything possible to 
look into each allegation noted in the complaint date d 8.6.2006 and 
after collating relevant materials, have formed its opinion, not only 
allegation -wise, but also offender -wise and witness -wise including to 
deal with the observations noted by the learned Amicus Curiae .   
71.  To the same end, it was alleged [bei ng allegation No. (xvi)] that 
the officers at the grassroot level were not transferred as per SIB’s 
recommendations till the arrival of Mr. K.P.S. Gill as Advisor to the 
Chief Minister, as stated by Mr. R.B. Sreekumar in his second 285  
 
affidavit dated 6.10.200 4 submitted to the Nanavati -Shah 
Commission.  Even this allegation has been dealt with by the SIT in 
the following words150: - 
“…..  
ALLEGATION No. XVI : 
Officers at grass -root level were not transferred as 
per State Intelligence Bureau's recommendation till the 
arrival of Shri K.P.S. Gill as Advisor to CM, as indicated by 
Sreekumar in his second affidavit dated 06.10.2004 to the 
Nanavati Commission . 
Shri R. B. Sreekumar has stated that after taking 
over as Addl. DG (Int.) on 09 -04-2002, he  had sent an 
analytical note on the Current Communal Scenario in 
Ahmedabad City on 24 -04-2002, to Shri Ashok Narayan, 
the then ACS (Home) with a copy to Shri K. Chakravarthi, 
the then DGP . In this report, Shri Sreekumar has stated that 
repeated and strong media attack on  Ahmedabad police had a 
demoralising impact on the confidence and dedication of the 
city police  personnel. He has further stated that many senior 
police officers at the decision taking level, i.e.  Inspectors in 
charge of the City police stat ions had ignored the specific 
instructions from the  official hierarchy on account of their 
getting direct verbal instructions from the senior political  
leaders of the ruling party. According to Shri Sreekumar, such 
officers had become adept in the  art of deceptive law 
enforcement for the benefit of their Political masters and 
friends, who  ensured their placement and continuance in their 
choicest executive posts at the cost of the spirit  and letter of 
the law of the land . 
In this report Shri Sreekumar had s uggested amongst 
other remedial measures, the  replacement of the present 
incumbents from executive posts at the cutting edge level fro m 
those  cities and districts, where police either remained inactive 
during the riots or played a  collaborative role with t he rioters.   
Shri Sreekumar also suggested that for deterrent, effect, police  
functionaries, who had played collaborative and participatory 
roles during the riots should  be given statutory punishment.  
 
150 pages 297 -298 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  286  
 
Shri Sreekumar has further stated that on 04 -05-2002 , 
Shri K. P. S. Gill, former DGP of  Punjab State, who had been 
deputed as an Adviser to the Chief Minister, Gujarat on Law &  
Order matter, convened a meeting of senior police officers in 
his camp at CRPF group centre,  Gandhinagar. Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, Shri P . C. Pande, Shri R. B. Sreekuma r, Shri 
Maniram, and  Shri M. K. Tandon, attended the meeting. As 
instructed by Shri Gill each officer gave his  assessment of the 
current situation. Both, DGP and CP, Ahmedabad city 
observed that the  situation was normal due t o effective police , 
measures. Shri Sreekumar has further stated that  Shri 
Maniram, who was responsible for maintaining Law & Order 
in the state , totally disagreed  with the assessment given by 
DGP .  And CP, Ahmedabad City .  According to the statement 
made  by Shri Maniram before the SIT, he had informed 
informed Shri K. P. S. Gill that the tension  continued to prevail 
in Ahmedabad city amongst the Hindus and Muslims and the 
officers, who  were responsible for not preventing the riots 
resulting in loss of life and property in their  jurisdiction should 
be transferred immediately irrespective of their status and 
good officers  posted in their place. Shri Maniram also stated to 
have mentioned to Shri Gill that wherever  effective officers had 
been posted, the Law & O rder situation was under control like, 
Saurashtra  and South Gujarat. In this meeting , Shri R. B. 
Sreekumar had fully endorsed the views of his  Shri Maniram, 
Shri Sreekumar also handed over a copy of his report sent vide 
letter dated 24 -04-2002 to Shri Gill  and had also prepared a 
separate note at the instance of Shri Gill. According to  Shri 
Sreekumar, Shri K. P. S. Gill had called him on 08 -05-2002, 
and informed that the  suggestions and remedial measures 
indicated in his (Sreekumar's) note here quite releva nt and  that 
soon most of the officers at the decision making levels in 
Ahmedabad City would be  transferred and a new team of 
officers positioned.  
Shri K. Chakravarthi has stated that during initial 
discussions with Shri K.P.S. Gill he along with Shri Ashok 
Narayan were given to understand that CM wanted to 
transfer the senior officers of Ahmedabad City and wanted 
alternate proposal. Shri Chakravarthi had accordingly 
given his suggestion to Shri Ashok Narayan, who prepared 
a note and submitted the same to the Chief Minister for 
his approval. According to Shri Chakravarthi, Shri K.P.S. 
Gill had asked him about his views on these transfers, to 
which Shri Chakravarthi informed him that he had given 
these suggestions. Shri Chakravarthi has further stated 287  
 
tha t this note was approved by the Chief Minister and the 
transfers came into force in the end of first week of May, 
2002. Shri Chakravarthi has also stated that the matter 
relating to the shifting of jurisdictional officers was 
already under consideration an d it was not taken up at the 
instance of either Shri Maniram o r Shri RB. Sreekumar.  
In view of this, the allegation of Shri Sreekumar that 
the transfers of the jurisdictional officers as suggested by 
State IB on 24 -04-2002, were not carried out till the ar rival 
of Shri K.P.S Gill, an Adviser to CM, is therefore, without 
any basis ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  
This analysis has been criticized amongst others on the ground that 
Mr. K.P.S. Gill has not been examined by the SIT.  Non -examination 
of Mr. K.P.S. Gill by the SIT can have no adverse impact on the 
otherwise well -considered opinion arrived at by the SIT in the final 
report on this aspect.  In any case, not translating the 
recommendation of SIB (dated 24.4.2002) into transfer order until 
end of first week of M ay, 2002, does not provide any direct link 
regarding the allegation of hatching larger criminal conspiracy at the 
highest level for causing or precipitating the violence across the State  
from February, 2002 onwards .  Viewed thus, no fault can be found 
with  the opinion of the SIT that the transfers of the jurisdictional 
officer, as suggested by the SIB, were not carried out till the arrival 
of Mr. K.P.S. Gill, Advisor to the Chief Minister , is of no avail .  The 288  
 
opinion of the SIT in this regard is a plausibl e view and had rightly 
commended to the Magistrate, as well as, the High Court.  
72.  That takes us to the other allegation, more or less of the same 
type being allegation No. (vii), namely, senior officers were awarded 
with undue benefits for collaborating with  the illegal plans of 
CM/BJP during 2002 riots and afterwards.  This has been found to 
be a far -fetched and unfounded allegation by the SIT, after analyzing 
the relevant materials on record including the statements of the 
concerned officials151, dealing wit h the case of each officer as named 
in paragraph 68 of the complaint.  Even this opinion of the SIT needs 
no second look also for the reason that such an act would not be a 
link to connect the act of hatching of criminal conspiracy resulting 
in mass violen ce across the State.  
73.  Argument was also advanced in reference to allegation No. (xv) 
that pro -VHP Advocates were appointed as public prosecutors in 
riots cases.  This has been thoroughly examined by the SIT in the 
following words152: - 
“…..  
 
151 pages 271 -280 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No . 2 
152 pages 294 -296 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  289  
 
ALLEGATION No. X V: 
Pro -VHP advocates were appointed as Public 
Prosecutors in ri ot cases as noted in Para 4  under the 
caption ‘Present Situation ’ in the complaint dated 
08.06.2006, wherein  appointments of advocates Shri 
Chetan Shah (as District Government Pleader), Shri V.P.  
Atre (as Special PP in the Gulberg case), Shri Raghuvir 
Pandya (as Special PP in the Best  Bakery case), Shri Dilip 
Trivedi (as Special PP in the Sardarpura case), Shri 
Rajendra  Darji (as Special PP in the Dipda Darvaja case),  
Shri Piyush Gandhi (PP in Panchmahal  District), have 
been questioned).  
Enquiries revealed that the procedure for the 
appointment of a Public Prosecutor in a town is that the 
vacancy is notified by the collector & District Magistrate 
in the local news pape rs. In response to the 
advertisement a number of eligible candidates are 
interviewed by a Board comprising Principal Sessions 
Judge and District Magistrate. Thereafter, a panel of 
three or four advocates selected by the Board is 
forwarded to the Govt. for the appointment of the Public 
Prosecutor. The Govt. exercises its own discretion, select 
and notify one of the empanelled candidates as a public 
Prosecutor for a period of three years. It may thus be seen 
though the selection procedure is transparent yet t he 
Govt. has got the discretion to appoint a particular 
lawyer out of the panel of 3 -4 advocates forwarded to 
them . 
Enquiries further revealed that Shri Chetan K. Shah 
remained a Member of Vishwa  Hindu Parishad during 1990 
to 1995. However, at present he i s neither a member of BJP 
nor any  of the Sangh Par ivar organisations. It has further 
come to light that on 12 -07-1986, seven or nine  members of 
Muslim Parivar were allegedly burnt alive in Meghaninagar 
area during the riots in  1986. A case in this regard w as 
registered in Shahibaug P.S. Shri Chetan K. Shah was not a 
FIR  named accused in this case, but was arraigned as an 
accused during the course of investigation  and charge sheet 
filed against him. After the committal proceedings this case 
was registered as  terrorist case no. 1/87 before the Hon'ble 
Special Court, Ahmedabad City. Shri Chetan K. Shah  was 
charged under TADA and other rioting offences. However, he 
was not arrested and instead  granted anticipatory bail and 
subsequently regular bail also. On his request to the BAR  
Association, Shri Chetan Shah was defended by Shri H.M. 
Dhruv and Shri J.M. Panchal , Shri J.M. Panchal , Sr. 
Advocates. After trial, Shri Chetan Shah was acquitted of all  
the charges.  290  
 
Shri Chetan K. selected as a Public Pros ecutor, as per 
laid down appointed as such on 17-06-2003 for a period of 
three years Before his appointment as PP, Shri Shah, had 
defended some  of the accused persons of the Gulberg Society 
case Some of them had been released on bail  during that 
period and Shri Shah, had represented them. Further, as a 
Public Prosecutor of Cit y Sessions Court, he had 15 
Additional Public Prosecutors, who used to work in different 
courts as  per duties allotted by Shri Chetan K. Shah. One 
Shri V. P. Atre, Additional Public Pro secutor  had been 
appointed as Special PP to conduct  case no 67/2002 of 
Meghaninagar P.S. on 06 -10-2003. It has further come to 
light that this was a special assignment given to Shri Atre by 
the Govt. of Gujarat directly and he was not junior or 
subordinate  to Shri Chetan K. Shah. In  Gulberg Society case, 
none of the accused persons were released on bail after Shri 
V. P. Atre  took over as Spl. PP. However , the accused persons 
were released on bail by the Gujarat High  court at different 
stages. Shri Chetan K.  Shah did not appear as a Public 
Prosecutor in any of the  riot cases pending in City Sessions 
Court, Ahmedabad City. He could not have appeared as a  
Public Prosecutor in Gulberg Society case as he had already 
appeared in this case from the  defence side. Sh ri Chetan K. 
Shah has denied that he had been appointed as a Public 
prosecutor  because of his VHP background or being a 
sympathizer of the ruling party or Sangh Parivar. The  three 
year term of Shri Chetan K. Shah had expired in June, 2006 
and was not exten ded .  Shri  Chetan K. shah has denied 
knowledge that Shri V. P. Atre had been appointed as a Spl. 
PP af ter a protest had been lodged by the eyewitnesses of the 
Gulberg Society case regarding his (Shri  Shah's) 
appointment. Both, Shri Chetan K. Shah and Shri Atre have 
denied that the latter worked  under the former . 
Shri H  M. Dhruv, Sr. Advocate has corroborated the 
version of Shri Chetan K. Shah and  has confirmed to have 
defended Shri Chetan K. Shah in a TADA case jointly with 
Shri J.M.  Panchal, Sr. Advocate, which ended in acquittal. 
He has further stated that he had been appointed  as Spl. PP 
to conduct the cases arising out of Meghaninagar P.S. C  R 
No. 67/2002 and Naroda  P. S. CR No. 100/2002 on 05 -03-
2009 and Shri Amit Patel, Advocate was appointed to assist  
him in the trial. However, Shri H. M. Dhruv did no t appear in 
any of these cases on any of the  dates as new Public 
Prosecutors were appointed by the Govt. of Gujarat on the 
recommendations  of SIT.  
Enquiries further revealed that Shri Raghuvir N. 
Pandya had started his practice in  District & Sessions Court, 
Vadodara in the year 1986 on Civil and criminal side . In the 
year  1997, he was appointed as Addl. PP in District & 291  
 
Sessions Court. Further, during the period  2000 -2002, he 
worked as a incharge P ublic Prosecutor Vadodara District. 
He was appointed as a  District Govt. Pleader in District 
Sessions Court, Vadodara in 2002 and worked there till 
2008.  He has denied any direct connection with BJP, Bajrang 
Dal, R SS or any of the Sangh Parivar  organisatio ns, but has 
admitted to have contested corporation elections from ward 
no. 20,  Majalpur as an independent candidate in the year 
1995, when he was elected. He remained  Corporator for a 
period of six years till 2001. He applied for appointment as a 
Notary in  the year  2001 and was appointed as a Notary by 
the Central Govt. He has also stated that the Best Bakery  
incident was a serious and sensitive case in Vadodara, as an 
aftermath of Godhra incident and  that he had conducted the 
prosecuted of this case as the  Chief Public Prosecutor of 
District &  Sessions Court in a sincere and diligent manner. 
According to Shri Pandya, it is incorrect to say  that all 
matters in the fast track Court Judge H. U. Mahida were 
being handled by Shri Gupta  Addl. PP. Shri Pandya has 
explained tha t keeping in view the work load as well as the  
availability of the prosecutors he used to divide the workload 
between different Prosecutors  including Shri Gupta , Addl.  
Shri Pandya is of the view that being the Chief Public 
Prosecutor of  Distr ict & Sessions Court, his appointment and 
notification in Best Bakery Case was not  necessary. Shri 
Raghu vir N. Pandya ceases to be a Public Prosecutor and 
Learned Fast Track  Court Judge Shri H. U. Mahida had 
already retired.  
Shri Dilip R. Trivedi, Advocate  from Mehsana has 
stated to have started his practice, as  an Advocate in 
Mehsana Courts in the year 1977. He was appointed as Govt. 
Advocate and  Public Prosecutor in Mehsana in April, 2000 
and remained there till the end of 2007. He is a  member of 
Rashtriy a Swayam Sevak Sangh since childhood. In 1992, he 
joined VHP as worker  and in 1999 , he become the General 
Secretary of VHP , Gujarat State. In 2006, he become the  
President of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Gujarat State. 
According to Shri Trivedi, Vishwa Hindu  Par ishad is a social 
Hindu organisation with no political inclinations and had not 
been banned.   According to Shri Trivedi post Godhra carnage 
there were riots in Mehsana District particularly  in 
Srdarpura, Tal - Vijapur and Dipda Darwaja, Visnagar and 
the bail application of accused  persons Involved in these 
cases were dealt with by him and other Addl. PPs. He has 
further  stated that the bail application of seven accused 
persons were argued by him in the Sessions  Court, Mehsana 
and the same were rejected. A ll these seven accused persons 
had approached the  Gujarat High Court and Subsequently 
Supreme Court also, but their bail applications were  rejected. 
Some other accused persons arrested in this case had also 292  
 
filed bail. Applications in the  Court and were gr anted bail. 
Further, as and when the accused persons were arrested in  
Sardapura case, Tal -Vijapur, they were released on bail on 
various conditions. The complainant  had filed petitions in 
Gujarat High Court vide Cr l. Misc. Appls. No. 3590/02, 
3591/02 & 402 6/02  against the bail order, which were 
dismissed by the High Court .  Shri Trevedi has added that as  
and when the accused persons filed their bail application the 
same were argued in an honest and  impartial manner 
depending upon the evidence available for and against the 
accused persons. He  has also stated that considering the 
arguments and the evidence available against and for the  
accused persons, as per police investigation, the court had 
either granted them bail or dismissed  their bail applications 
on m erits and that the same was purely the discretion of the 
court. In these  cases the charge sheets were filed by the IO 
in the concerned Court of the competent jurisdiction,  but the 
trail was not conducted by him.  
Shri Rajendra Darji, Advocate had denied any  
connection with Vishwa Hindu Parishad , Bajrang Dal or any 
of the connected organisations. He has stated that he become 
Addl. PP and  Addl. Govt. Pleader in Mehsana District in April 
2000 and reminded there till 2004. In 2005, he  appeared for 
the interview and was appointed as Addl. Govt. Pleader and 
till 2007. In 2008, he  was again appointed as Addl. Govt. 
Pleader and he continues to be the Addl. PP. He has stated  
that Dipada Darwaja case was charge sheeted in the first 
Fast Track Court of Shri P. R. Patel and  subsequently 
transferred to the Court of Shri S. J. Seth and again 
transferred to the Court of Shri  I. B. Waghela, Initially, Shri 
R. M. Jani was the Prosecutor in this case, who examined 11 
witnesses. Thereafter, this case was conducted by Shri 
Nirmal bha i S. Shah, Govt. Advocate, who  examined 16 
witnesses .  Later on he had further stated that he had got 
dismissed the bail  application of the seven accused persons 
from the Court. He has also stated to have dealt with  this 
case in an independent and impar tial manner . 
Shri Piyush L. Gandhi, Advocate remained a R SS 
activist since 1964, a worker of Akhil  Bhartiya Vidharthi 
Parishad between 1968 to  1972, District Pramukh of Janta -
Yuva Morcha  between 1973 to 1980, Secretary of 
Panchmahal District VHP between 19 82 to 1990, Officiating  
Pramukh of Panchmahal District VHP between 1990 to 2006 
and Administrator of schools  associated with Vidya Bharti  
since 2006 till date. He had also been appointed as Director 
of Godhra City CO -operative Bank in 1996 and treasurer of 
National Blind Samiti in 1994. He  remained Govt. Advocate 
and Public Prosecutor of Panchmahal from 15 -01-1996 to 
01-09-2009.   He has stated that in the riot cases post Godhra 293  
 
carnage in the year 2002, Shri J. G. Pathak and  Shri B. J. 
Trivedi a dvocates were appoint ed as Spl . PPs to conduct the 
trial of these cases.  However, this appointment was cancelled 
with effect from 04 -12-2003 and these cases were  entrusted 
to him for trial. However, in some of the cases, Shri Rajendra 
Trivedi, Shri A. R. D ave  and Shri D. P. Pathak were also 
appointed as Spl. PPs. Shri Gandhi has also stated that he 
had  conducted the trial of Shabana -Suhana bang rape and 
murder case and that in this case, the  complainants had filed 
Crl. Revision Apps. NO. 94/2004 & 142/2004 in Gujarat 
High Court in  Gujarat High Court, in which some allegations 
had been levelled against him. He has further  stated that the 
Gujarat High Court had dismissed these allegations on the 
first date of hearing on  12-10-2004. He has also stated that 
he h ad concluded the trial of this case and many of the  
accused persons w ere convicted, and awarded life 
imprisonment. He has also stated that appeals  had been filed 
against the acquittal of some of the other accused persons in 
this case in the  Gujarat High Co urt.  
On overall examination of these allegations, it 
appears that government had usual practice of 
appointment of government pleaders, the political 
affiliation of the advocates did weigh with the Govt. for 
the appointment of the Public Prosecutors. Howeve r, no 
specific allegation of showing favour by them to any of 
the accused persons involved in the riots either in grant 
of bail or during the trial has come to light ……”  
(emphasis supplied)  
We fail to understand as to how this act can be linked with the 
allegation of hatching of criminal conspiracy for causing or 
precipitating mass violence across the State.  The appellant having 
failed to provide sufficient material to raise serious suspicion in 
respect of allegation of hatching of criminal conspiracy for t he 
intended mass violence, cannot be heard to make that deficiency by 
raising allegation of the kind of appointments of public prosecutors 
during the trial of the concerned cases.  Be that as it may, the 294  
 
allegation clearly overlooks the procedure regarding  appointment of 
a public prosecutor.  It begins with notification by the Collector and 
District Magistrate in the local newspaper and the eligible 
candidates are interviewed by a Board comprising of Principal 
Sessions Judge and District Magistrate.  Such b eing the selection 
process for appointment of public prosecutors, the allegation under 
consideration has been rightly discarded by the SIT albeit  after 
thorough analysis of all aspects relevant in that regard.   There is 
nothing to indicate that any grievan ce was received by the SIT from 
any quarter during the trial of nine  cases assigned to it by this Court 
for investigation , else there is no reason to doubt that SIT would 
have taken corrective measures and made appropriate 
recommendations for being given e ffect to by the concerned 
authorities in terms of the order of this Court dated 1.5.2009152A. 
74.  Similarly, the allegation No. (xvii) about failure to take action 
against the print media has been discarded by the SIT153 being 
insufficient evidence to make out any criminal case against the 
named offenders.  It is a different matter that such publication must 
 
152A supra at Footnote No. 18  
153 pages 298 -301 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  295  
 
have been released, but no material is forthcoming that it has been 
done at the behest of the named offenders or th ey prevented the local 
police from taking action in that regard.  Emphasis was also placed 
by the appellant on the speeches delivered by Dr. Praveen Togadia, 
named as offender No. 20 in his capacity as International General 
Secretary, VHP.  However, that p iece of material cannot be the basis 
to link it with the allegation of larger criminal conspiracy hatched at 
the highest level for causing and precipitating mass violence across 
the State against the minority community during the relevant period.  
Further,  232 crimes regarding hate speeches came to be registered 
against the concerned persons across the State.  The SIT in 
connection with the complaint of appellant, was not expected to 
enquire into utterances made by different persons constituting hate 
speech  during the surcharged situation of riots, as the remit of the 
SIT was to enquire into the allegation of larger criminal conspiracy 
at the highest level resulting in spreading of mass violence across 
the State during the relevant time.  
75.  Even the allegation No. (xviii) that State Home Department gave 
misleading reports about normalcy to the State Election 
Commission, has been discarded by the SIT after analyzing the 
relevant facts including the decision about the timing to conduct 296  
 
elections was that of the El ection Commission.  That was taken by 
the Election Commission of India despite not accepting the statistics 
furnished by the State.  
76.  Reverting to the allegation regarding secret meeting [allegation 
No. (xxxi) discussed at pages 329 -332154] and meeting held b y Mr. 
Kalubhai Hirabhai Maliwad [allegation No. (xxxii) discussed at pages 
332 -337155], the SIT after thorough investigation and analyzing the 
relevant materials, has opined that the same are figment of 
imagination replete with inaccuracies and contradictio ns. 
77.  Our attention was drawn to the recommendations of the NHRC 
and also the report of the private Tribunal, named as Concerned 
Citizens Tribunal.  The narrative recorded therein cannot be the sole 
basis to proceed against the offenders.  Whereas, dependent  upon 
the quality of materials gathered by the SIT during thorough 
investigation done by it on all factual aspects including the ones 
referred to by the NHRC and the private Tribunal, the SIT could form 
its independent opinion.   The SIT had precisely follo wed this  route 
 
154 pages 329 -332 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  
155 pages 332 -337 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  297  
 
before submitting the final report to the concerned Magistrate as per 
the direction given by this Court.  
78.  The appellant had urged that the SIT had not investigated the 
willful failure of the fire brigade in Ahmedabad to respond to the calls 
made by the minority community being part of the criminal 
conspiracy.  This argument is unfounded and tenuous.  The fire 
services in Ahmedabad City come within the jurisdiction of 
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation and not the State police or the 
State civil a dministration.  The Commissioner of Police of 
.Ahmedabad City, who has been blamed by the appellant, had 
nothing to do with the functioning of the fire brigade.  No tangible 
material is forthcoming to indicate that the Commissioner of Police 
of Ahmedabad C ity had issued instructions to the officials of fire 
services in Ahmedabad City under the control of the Ahmedabad 
Municipal Corporation.  Whereas, the materials collected by the SIT 
would reveal that in the entire city of Ahmedabad, blockades were 
created  at various locations due to mass violence, making it difficult, 
if not impossible, for movement of the vehicles such as fire brigade.  
In any case, this argument is one of inaction or failure of fire services 
in the Ahmedabad City.  That cannot be the bas is to infer criminal 298  
 
conspiracy, much less hatched at the highest level  to cause mass 
violence across the State . 
79.  The respondents had justly contended that the attempt of the 
appellant was to keep in improvising their grievances and make new 
allegations including to involve new offenders as being party to the 
larger criminal conspiracy hatched at the highest level.  A ppellant in 
filing the protest petition had the gumption to assert that the list of 
persons was not exhaustive besides naming new persons as 
offenders.  In the name of protest petition  (running into 514  pages) , 
appellant was also indirectly questioning the decisions rendered by 
the Courts in other cases including sub judice  matters, for reasons 
best known to her.  She was obviously doing so under dictation of 
someone.   In fact, the sizeable contents of the protest petition are 
founded on the affidavits filed by those persons, whose  version have 
been found to be replete with falsehood.  
80.  Be that as it may, after going through the analysis done by the 
SIT of the concerned allegations, we have no hesitation in accepting 
such opinion that no case had been made out against the named 299  
 
offend ers, much less to indicate being party to the hatching of larger 
criminal conspiracy to cause or precipitate mass violence across the 
State against the minority community during the relevant period . 
81.  It is, therefore, not open to hold that the investigation  by the 
SIT in the present case has been deficient or infirm.  Suffice it to 
observe that every allegation found in the complaint (running into 
67 pages) had been culled out by the SIT and articulated in the form 
of thirty -two (32) broad allegations .  The same  had been duly 
inves tigated from all angles before submitting the report to this 
Court.  The analysis and opinion of the SIT of the materials collected 
during investigation allegation -wise, witness -wise as well as, 
offender -wise are broadly agreed upon even by the learned Ami cus 
Curiae  - except the observations made regarding some matters, 
which observations have also been thoroughly enquired into by the 
SIT by way of further investigation and duly analyzed for recording 
its opinion156 (appended as Annexure -1 to this judgment) , in the final 
report presented to the concerned Court.  The Magistrate, as well as, 
the High Court have accepted the final report presented by the SIT .  
For , there is no material worth the name to even create a su spicion 
(leave alone strong suspicion and a ground for presuming that the 
 
156 pages 398 -467 of original copy of the final report forming part of Convenience Compilation of  respondent No. 2  300  
 
named offenders had committed an offence  of larger conspiracy ), 
indicative of the meeting of the minds of all concerned at some level ; 
and in particular, the bureaucrats, politicians , public prosecutors, 
VHP, RSS, Bajrang Dal or the members of the State political 
establishment - for hatching a larger criminal conspiracy at the 
highest level to cause and precipitate mass violence against the 
minority community across the State during the relevant period .  
Such conclusion reached by the Magistrate and the High Court is 
unexceptionable.  
82.  We may hasten to add that our understanding about the thrust 
of the approach adopted by the SIT is not to form opinion because 
of doubting the credibility  of the witnesses as such, which indeed 
would have been a matter for trial.  However, the SIT went by the 
logic of falsity of the information or material, including the same 
remaining uncorroborated despite the best endeavour made by the 
SIT.  It is certai nly not a case of failure of SIT in doing proper 
investigation into the allegations of larger conspiracy as such.  The 
SIT was obviously conscious that it would not be a case of strong 
suspicion about the commission of offence of larger criminal 
conspiracy  - absent credible, verifiable and corroborated 
information/material.  It is for that reason it had to record its 301  
 
unambiguous opinion after duly analyzing all angles and the 
information/material collated during the enquiry/investigation - 
that there was no  case for proceeding against the named offender(s) 
as the offences under the relevant sections of law were not made out; 
and, therefore, to urge upon the Magistrate to accept the final 
report/closure report.  This is not to say that the SIT and the Courts 
have doubted the occurrence of instances registered as crimes 
during the relevant period, nor have put a seal of approval to such 
heart -rending instances.  Whereas, every registered crime in that 
regard (including the unfortunate gruesome killing of husban d of 
appellant), has been duly investigated by the Court appointed SIT 
and accused person(s) involved in commission of such crimes have 
been duly identified and had to face the trial before the jurisdictional 
Courts.  
83.  Relying on the decision in Nirmal Singh Kahlon157, it was 
urged that if it is open to file second FIR in connection with the 
alleged offence, the self -imposed remit of the SIT can be no 
impediment for proceeding against the concerned persons on the 
basis of  further information/material referred to in the protest 
 
157 supra at Footnote No. 4 4 302  
 
petition or which comes to the notice of the appellant in due course.  
The argument, though attractive at the first blush, has been stated 
only to be rejected.  In that, for the view that we have taken hitherto 
that the SIT, as well as, the Courts including the appellant is bound 
by the sui generis directions issued by this Court from time to time, 
the matter could be examined only in that context  and not in 
reference to the approach to be adopted in general cases.  
Furthermore, the SIT has observed that the so-called additional 
information/material would not improve the case of the appellant, 
as taking the same as it is, there is no indication the rein about the 
perceivable link to show hatching of criminal conspiracy at the 
highest level for causing and precipitating mass violence across the 
State against the minority community during the relevant period.  
84.  The SIT was entrusted with investigation of  nine (9) sets of 
crimes including the occurrences at the Gulberg Society.  Status 
reports regarding the progress of investigation was submitted to this 
Court in all those cases and after satisfaction of this Court about the 
completion of proper investigat ion done by the SIT, report(s) under 
Section 173 of the Code came to be filed in the concerned cases and 
the identified persons involved in commission of crime(s) were also 303  
 
sent for trial.  Moreover, the trials of the concerned cases had 
progressed under c ontinuous supervision of this Court, which have 
ended in conviction of accused in the concerned cases, as indicated 
in the Chart submitted alongwith Final Note Part -1 filed on behalf of 
respondent No. 2, marked as Annexure -2157A and deemed to be part 
of this j udgment.  
85.  Despite the humungous task undertaken by the members of 
the SIT with sincerity, objectivity and dispassionately including to 
the satisfaction of this Court in all these cases, the argument of the 
appellant was bordering on undermining the integrit y and sincerity 
of the members of the SIT.  Needless to underscore that the SIT came 
to be constituted by this Court of experienced senior officials with 
proven ability of investigating complex offences .  Therefore, w e find 
such submission as not only far -fetched and an attempt to undo and 
undermine the industry of the SIT in having thoroughly investigat ed 
all the nine (9) sets of cases assigned to it by this Court, but also in 
the nature of questioning the wisdom of this Court.  Hence, the 
 
157A Anne xure-2 (at pages 450 -452 of this judgment ) 304  
 
assail of the ap pellant needs to be stated to be rejected.  While 
observing sobriety, we say no more.  
86.  We do not wish to dilate on the other reported decisions, for the 
view we have taken and more so, we have followed the settled legal 
principles in answering the matter s in issue.  
87.  We need to clarify that our analysis regarding sting operation 
or the Tehelka Tape and its transcript , is not a final determination 
regarding the evidentiary value thereof .  We say so because the same 
will have to be dealt with in appropriate pr oceedings, in particular, 
other cognate criminal cases investigated by the Supreme Court 
appointed SIT including those pending before the High Court and 
this Court.  
88.  While parting, we express our appreciation for the indefatigable 
work done by the team of SIT officials in the challenging 
circumstances they had to face and yet, we find that they have come 
out with flying colours unscathed.  At the end of the day, it app ears 
to us that a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State 
of Gujarat alongwith others was to create sensation by making 
revelations which were false to their own knowledge. The falsity of 
their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT af ter a thorough 
investigation.  Intriguingly, the present proceedings have been 305  
 
pursued for last 16 years (from submission of complaint dated 
8.6.2006  running into 67 pages  and t hen by filing protest petition  
dated 15.4.2013 running into 514  pages ) including with the audacity 
to question the integrity of every functionary involved in the process 
of exp osing the devious stratagem adopted (to borrow the 
submission of learned counsel for the SIT), to keep the pot boiling , 
obviously , for ulterior design.  As a matter of fact, all those involved 
in such abuse of process, need to be in the dock and procee ded with 
in accordance with law.  
89.  To sum up, we are of the considered opinion that no fault can 
be found with the approach of the SIT in submitting final report 
dated 8.2.2012, which is backed by firm logic, expositing analytical 
mind and dealing with all a spects objectively for discarding the 
allegations regarding larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level) 
for causing and precipitating mass violence across the State against 
the minority community during the relevant period.  As 
aforementioned , the SI T has gone by the logic of falsity of the 
information or material and including the same remaining 
uncorroborated.  In that, the materials collected during the 
investigation do not give rise to strong or grave suspicion regarding 
hatching of larger criminal conspir acy at the highest level for causing 306  
 
mass violence across the State against the minority community and 
more so, indicating involvement of the named offenders and their 
meeting of minds at some level in that regard.  The SIT had formed 
its opinion after con sidering all the materials collated during the 
investigation.  The question of further investigation would have 
arisen only on the availability of new material/information in 
connection with the allegation of larger conspiracy at the highest 
level, which is not forthco ming in this case.  Hence, the final report, 
as submitted by the SIT, ought to be accepted as it is, without doing 
anything more.  
90.  The Magistrate, upon presentation of final report could have 
exercised different options – as predicated in Abhinandan Jha158, 
Bhagwant Singh159, Popular Muthiah160 and  Vishnu Kumar 
Tiwari161.  However, the Magistrate in the present case, after 
applying his mind independently to the final report dated 8.2.2012 
and the materials appended thereto, chose to accept the same as it 
is, without issuing any other direction to the SIT.   
 
158 supra at Footnote No. 2 8 
159 supra at Footnote No. 2 1 
160 supra at Footnote No. 30 
161 supra at Footnote No. 2 7 307  
 
91.  After cogitating over the matter, we uphold the decision of the 
Magistrate in accepting the stated final report dated 8.2.2012 
submitted by the SIT, as it is  and rejecting t he protest petition filed 
by the appellant.  We do not countenance the submission of the 
appellant r egarding infraction of rule of law in the matter of 
investigation and the approach of the Magistrate and the High Court 
in dealing with the final report.  
92.  Accordingly, we hold that this appeal is devoid of merits and 
resultantly, deserves to be dismissed  in the aforementioned terms .  
We order accordingly.  
Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of 
accordingly.

❖ Opinion of Shri Raju Ramchandran, Amicus Curiae: - 
Shri Raju Ramchandran, Sr. Advocate assisted by Shri Gaurav 
Aggarwal, Advocate had been appointed as Amicus Curiae by the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court of India to assist the Court in this matter. Shri Raju 
Ramchandran, AC initially examined the Inquiry Report submitted by the 
SIT to the Ho n'ble Supreme Court of India and submitted his observations 
on the findings of the SIT on 20.0l.2011, to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
India, in three parts i.e. Chart 'A', Chart 'B' & Chart 'C' . 
The aforesaid observations made by the Ld. Amicus Curiae were  
considered by the Hon’ble Spl. Bench of Supreme Court of India on 
15.03.2011, when the following observations were made: - 
“A copy of the note submitted by the learned amicus Curiae has 
already been supplied to the Chairman, Special Investigation Team 
(SIT ). Let the Chairman, SIT, look into the observations made by the 
learned amicus curiae against each of the findings given by the SIT 
on the allegations made in the complaint and submit this report 
thereon. If considered necessary, it will be open to the SI T to carry out 
further investigation in light of the observations made in the said note. 
The report shall be submitted by 25th April, 2011. List the case on 27th 
April, 2011 at 3:00 p.m.”  
 Pursuant to the aforesaid order, SIT conducted further 
investigatio n u/s 173(8) Cr.P.C. in Gulberg Society Case 
(Meghaninagar P.S. 1 CR No.67/02) as suggested by Ld. Amicus 
Curiae in his observations submitted in the note dated 20.01.2011 
to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India .  
 The recommendations made in Chart ‘A’ by th e Ld. Amicus Curiae 
vis-à-vis further investigation conducted is discussed below: - 
Chart - ‘A’ 
ALLEGATIONS  FINDINGS  OBSERVATIONS  
I & IV : A 
statement was 1. None of the officers 
that attended the 1.It would be 
impossible to get 
 
162 see para 3 3 of this judgment  
309  
 
made by Shri 
Narendra Modi 
on 27-02-2002, 
in a meeting  at 
his residence 
instructing the 
senior officers to 
allow the · 
Hindus to give 
vent to their 
anger.  This is 
also  supported  
by Late Haren  
Pandya.  
 meeting on 27 -02-
2002, have confirmed 
the alleged statement 
made by Shri 
Narendra Mod i 
2. The statement of 
Shri R. B. Sreekumar 
is hearsay.  
 
3.Sanjiv Bhatt, the 
then DCI (Security)  was  
not  present  in the  
meeting.  
 
4. None of the Cabinet  
Ministers, including 
Late Haren Pandya 
attended the meeting 
on 27 -02-2002.  
Testimony of Late 
Haren Padya  before  the 
Citizen's Tribunal is  
unreliable.  
 anyone present in the  
meeting on 27 -02-
2002 to speak against 
Shri  Modi, especially 
the  bureaucracy and  
police  officials.  
 
2.The other 
circumstances would  
also  have  to be taken 
into account. There is 
nothing  to show  that  
the  CM intervened  on 
28-02-2002,  when the 
riots were taking place 
to prevent the riots. 
The  movement  of Shri  
Modi and  the  
instructions  given by 
him on 28 -02-2002, 
would have been 
decisive to prove that  
he had  taken  all steps 
for the protection of 
the minorities, but this 
evidence is not there. 
Neither the CM nor  his 
personal  officials have 
stated what he did on 
28-02-2002. Neither 
the top police nor 
bureaucrats have 
spoken about any 
decisive action by the  
CM.  
 
-----------------------------  
Page: 399 
 
3. It may not be 
correct to rule out the 
310  
 
presence of Sanjiv 
Bhatt, IPS, DC (Int.) 
since Addl. DC (Int.) 
Shri G.C. Raiger was 
not available. There is 
no reason for him to 
make a wrong 
statement. He was 
willing to make a 
statement if he was 
protected from legal 
repercussions of 
disclos ing what 
transpired in the 
meeting.  
  
4. It is difficult to 
believe that when the 
CM came back after 
the Godhra trip, no 
Minister was present 
at his residence. 
Hence, it may not be 
totally unbelievable. 
Shri Haren Pandya is 
unfortunately dead, 
but the stat ements 
made by Late Haren 
Pandya to Justice P.B. 
Sawant (Retd.) and 
Justice H. Suresh 
(Retd.) can be used, 
even if his statement 
is not been formally 
reproduced in writing 
by the Citizen’s 
Tribunal.  
 
5. It has also been 
brought out that an 
enquiry was mad e 
from CM’s office as to 311  
 
the identity of the 
Minister who had 
deposed before the 
Citizen’s Tribunal and 
that the State 
Intelligence Bureau 
had verified the 
identity as that of 
Shri Haren Pandya. 
This also gives some 
corroboration to the 
fact that the CM’s 
office was 
uncomfortable with 
the disclosure made 
by an unidentified 
Minister to the 
Citizen’s Tribunal.  
 
6. The statement of 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar 
cannot be discarded 
as hearsay, in the 
light of Section 6 of 
the Evidence Act.  
 
7. Another aspect is 
the fac t that VHP 
General Secretary 
Jaydeep Patel and Shri 
Modi were at Godhra on 
27.02.2002. The 
statement of Jaydeep 
Patel that he did not 
meet Shri Narendra 
Modi at Godhra does 
not inspire  
 
 
 
 312  
 
-----------------------------  
Page: 400 
 
confidence. This has to 
be examined as the 
Mamlatdar would not 
have handed over the 
dead bodies to a non -
government person i.e. 
Jaydeep Patel until and 
unless somebody very 
high told him to do so.  
V. That Cabinet 
Ministers Shri I.K. 
Jadeja and Shri 
Ashok Bhatt were 
positioned in 
DGP’s office and 
Ahmedabad City 
Control Room on 
28.02.2002.  The SIT concludes that 
this was a “Controversial 
decision” taken by the 
Govt. to place two 
ministers in the DGP’s 
office and Ahmedabad 
City Control Room. 
However, SIT concludes 
that there is no evidence 
that the 2 Ministers 
passed on any 
instructions to the police 
to deal with riots in 
particular manner. 
Therefore, the allegation 
is only partially proved 
as per SIT.  8. The positioning of 2 
Cabinet Ministers 
having nothing to do 
with the home 
portfolio in the Office 
of DGP and the State 
Police Control Room 
respectively is another 
circumstance which 
reflects that there was 
a direct instruction 
from the Chief 
Minister. Though Shri 
Jadeja says that he had 
gone to the DGP’s 
office on instr uctions 
of Shri Gordhan 
Zadafia, MoS (Home) 
this is highly 
unbelievable. It is 
obvious that the Chief 
Minister had 
positioned these 2 
Ministers in highly 
sensitive places which 
should not have been 
done. Infact, these 2 
Ministers could have 
taken active st eps to 
defuse the riots, but 
313  
 
they did nothing, 
which speaks volumes 
about the decision to 
let the riots happen. It 
does not appear that 
these 2 Ministers 
immediately called the 
CM and told him about 
the situation at 
Gulberg and other 
places.  
 
9. SIT merely  relied 
upon the statement of 
the police officers to 
conclude that these 2 
Ministers did not give 
any instructions to 
Police department, but 
it appears highly 
unlikely that 2 Cabinet 
Ministers of the 
Government of Gujarat 
would have not given 
some kind of directions 
when the CM had 
directed them to 
remain present.  
10. It is obvious that 
the 2 Ministers were 
fully aware of the 
developing situation in 
Gulberg Society, 
Naroda Patiya etc. in 
Ahmedabad City. They 
were duty bound to 
convey the situation to 
the C hief Minister and 
were required to do 
everything  
 
 314  
 
 
 
 
-----------------------------  
Page: 401 
 
possible to save loss of 
lives. If the stand of the 
CM that these 2 
Ministers were 
positioned so as to 
effectively control the 
law and order situation 
is correct, then there 
would have been a far 
quicker action to 
control the riots in 
Gulberg Society and  
Naroda Patiya atleast.  
 
11. No tangible action 
seems to have been 
taken by the police 
high ups in the Police 
Department, namely 
Commissioner of 
Police, to control the 
riots at Gulberg 
Society. Gulberg 
Society is not very far 
away from the Office of 
Commissioner of 
Police, Ahmedabad.  
XI. The allegation 
is that Shri 
Narendra Modi 
did not visit the 
riot affected areas 
of Ahmedabad 
immediately, 
though he visited 
Godhra on the The SIT has come to the 
conclusion that the 
action of Chi ef Minister 
appeared to be 
discriminatory.  12. This is one of the 
circumstances which 
indicate that the 
Hon’ble Chief Minister 
had not taken enough 
steps to ensure that 
riots in Ahmedabad 
City were immediately 
315  
 
day of the 
incident.  controlled by his direct 
intervention.  
XII. It is alleged 
that on 01 -03-
2002, Shri 
Narendra Modi 
said in a television 
interview that the 
reaction of the 
Hindus was due 
to the action by 
the Muslims, 
which seems to 
justify the riot.   The SIT has come to the 
conclusion that the 
reaction of the Chief 
Minister to violence at 
Gulberg Society and 
Naroda Patiya was not 
serious. However, the 
SIT has concluded this 
would not be sufficient 
enough to make out a 
case against Shri Modi.  13. The observation of 
Shri Modi in a 
television interview on 
01-03-2002 clearly 
indicates that there 
was an attempt to 
justify the violence 
against the minority 
community. This 
indicates a certain 
approach. The 
statement made by 
Shri Modi cannot be 
seen in isolation. It has 
to be seen in 
conjunction with other 
facts  mentioned 
hereinabove which 
provides sufficient 
justification for a 
detailed investigation 
in the matter.  
 
Observations made by Ld. Amicus Curiae:  
It would be impossible to get anyone present in the meeting on 27 -
02-2002 to speak against Shri Modi, espe cially the bureaucracy and 
police officials.  
It may not be correct to rule out the presence of Sanjiv Bhatt, IPS, 
DC (Int.) since Addl. DC (Int.) Shri G.C. Raiger was not available. 
There is no reason for him to make a wrong statement. He was 
willing to m ake a statement if he was protected from legal 
repercussions of disclosing what transpired in the meeting . 
 
Result of further Investigation:  
 
Further investigation in this regard revealed that the 
information about the burning of a railway coach of Sabarmati 
Express near Godhra Railway Station was received by Shri Narendra 316  
 
Modi, Chief Minister on 27.02.2002 at about 0900 hrs. from Shri 
Ashok Nar ayan, the then ACS

(Home). On receipt of the information, Shri Narendra Modi held a 
meeting at around 1030 hrs. with Shri Gordhan Zadafia, the then 
MoS  (Home), Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home), Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP, Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP, 
Ahmedabad City and other personal staff of CM. Till then, no specific 
information was available about the number of casualties and the 
injur ed persons. In this meeting, Shri Narendra Modi emphasised 
that the culprits responsible for the incident should be apprehended 
and not allowed to escape. No minutes of the meeting were prepared. 
However, Shri Ashok Narayan had prepared a note on the basis  of 
information provided by DGP for CM and MoS (Home) to make a 
statement in the Assembly as the question relating to the Godhra 
incident was likely to be raised in the Assembly which was in Session.  
The Chief Minister had given directions that the steps should be 
taken not to delay the medical help to surviving passengers and also 
to impose curfew to avoid any untoward incident.  Godhra being a 
communally sensitive place.  The Chief Minister had also instructed 
that the senior officers and the extra force , if required, must reach 
Godhra without any delay . 
Around 1200 hrs, Chief Minister attended the Assembly session and 
a call attention motion relating to the Godhra incident tabled by Shri 
Punjabhai Vansh, MLA came up for discussion at 1300 hrs, but the 
Hon'ble Member was not present in the House. Dr. Mayaben Kodnani, 
MLA from Naroda spoke on the said issue.  Shri Gordhan Zadafia, the 
then MoS (Home) made a statement in the House based on the aforesaid 
note prepared by Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home ). During zero 
hour, Shri Narendra Modi made a statement that he had discussed 
the matter with the then Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpaee and 
announced an ex -gratia payment of Rs. 2,00,000/ - each to the next 
of kin of those killed in the Godhra incid ent and also ordered a High -
Level Inquiry into the incident.  All these facts were mentioned in 
the Assembly proceedings, as well as in the press release issued by 
the Govt. of Gujarat on 27 -02-2002 .  
317  
 
Shri Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home) left for God hra by road 
around 1400 hrs. and reached there at about 1630 hrs, Shri Ashok Bhatt, 
the then Health Minister had already reached Godhra around 1200 hrs. 
It may be mentioned here that 27 -02-2002 was a budget day in the 
Assembly and after the completion of t he budget speech by Shri Nitinbhai 
Patel, the then Finance Minister, the Assembly proceedings were over at 
about 1500 hrs. Shri Narendra Modi left for Ahmedabad airport around  
1530 hrs for his onward journey to Vadodara / Godhra. Shri Narendra 
Modi reached Ahmedabad airport at 1600 hrs and left for Vadodara 
by Govt. aircraft. The Chief Minister reached Vadodara at about 1630 
hrs. and then proceeded to Godhra by helicopter immedi ately, where 
he reached around 1645 hrs. He was accompanied by Shri Anil 
Mukim, the then Addl. PS to CM and Shri Jagdish Thakker, PRO to 
CM. According to the press release issued by the Govt. of Gujarat on 
27-02-2002, CM visited the scene of occurrence at Godhra Railway 
Station and then went to Civil Hospital and saw the injured admitted 
there. Thereafter, he went to Collectorate and held meeting with the 
Ministers present there namely Shri Ashok Bhatt, Shri Gordhan 
Zadafia, Shri Bhupendra Lakhawala, Shri P rabhatsinh Chauhan (all 
Ministers in the State Govt.) Shri Bhupendrasingh Solanki, the then 
Member, Lok -Sabha from Godhra, Collector & District Magistrate, 
Godhra, Police Officers and Railway Officers. The Chief Minister had 
also met the press briefly ther eafter. As per media reports Shri 
Narendra Modi said the Govt. would ensure the maintenance of peace 
in the State and the Govt. would not be lacking in discharge of its 
duty. He also said that tragedy was unparallel in the history of 
Gujarat and assured th e people that culprits would be punished. At 
no point of time, Shri Jaydeep Patel, VHP leader, who was at Godhra 
on that day, had met him. The Chief Minister left Godhra by road 
around 1945 hrs (after the sunset) and reached Vadodara airport at 
about 2130 hrs. Shri Narendra Modi left for Ahmedabad by Govt. 
aircraft at 2130 hrs and reached his official residence at Gandhinagar 
at about 2230 hrs.  
Investigation has further revealed that a law & order meeting 
was held by Chief Minister at his residence around 2300 hrs, which 
was attended by Smt. Swarna Kanta Varma, the then acting Chief 
Secretary, Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home) Dr. P.K. Mishra, 
the then Principal Secretary to CM, Shri Anil Mukim the then Addl. 
PS to CM, Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then D GP, Shri P.C. Pande, the 
then CP, Ahmedabad City, Shri K. Nityanandam, the then Secretary 
(Home) and Shri Prakash S. Shah, the then Addl. Secretary (Law & 318  
 
order). Shri G.C. Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.), who was on casual 
leave and had returned to Ahmed abad on 27 -02-2002 evening, had 
not attended the same. However, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then Deputy 
Commissioner of Intelligence (Security) has claimed to have 
attended the said meeting at the instance of DGP .

All the aforesaid officials have been re -examined and their 
statements recorded u/s 161 Cr.P.C . Their deposition in brief is given 
below: - 
(i) According to Smt. Swarna Kanta Varma , the then acting Chief 
Secretary, she was present in the said meeting, but she can not recollect,

riots .

categorically denied the presence of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI 
(Security) in the meeting of 27 -02-2002. He has further denied the 
presence of any politicians in the said meeting. As regards the 
observation allegedly made by CM that for too long the Gujarat Police 
had been following the principle of balancing actions against the 
Hindus and Muslims while  dealing with the communal riots in 
Gujarat; the situation warranted that the Muslims be taught a lesson

and informed him about his arrival at Ahmedabad. However, he has 
categorically stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not attend the said 
meeting on 27 -02-2002 night at CM's residence and no such 
instructions were given by Chief Minister.  Shri Chakrava rthi has 
added that in case Shri G.C. Raiger was available at Ahmedabad, he 
would have given instructions to him to attend this meeting through the 
State Control Room rather than asking Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to attend.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 405 
 
28.02.2002, but had curtailed his leave and cam e back to Ahmedabad on 
27.02.2002 evening. This fact has been confirmed by Shri G.C. Raiger, 
the then Addl. DG (Int.), who has stated to have called DGP and informed 
about his availability from the evening of 27.02.2002. Moreover, Shri P. 
B. Upadhay, the t hen DCI (Communal), the concerned officer dealing with 
the communal subject has also stated to have curtailed his casual leave 
on 27.02.2002 and was available in the office. He also stated that he 
had accompanied Shri K. Chakravarthi in the latter's car fr om DGP's 
office to CM's residence and claimed that he attended the said 
meeting, which was also attended by Incharge Chief Secretary Smt. 
Swarna Kanta Varma, ACS (Home) Shri Ashok Narayan, Shri Anil 
Mukim, the then Addl. PS to CM, Shri P.C. Pande, the then  CP, 
Ahmedabad City and Shri K.Nityanandam, the then Secretary 
(Home). However, he is unable to recollect, as to whether Shri P.K. 
Mishra, the then Principal Secretary to CM was present in the said 
meeting or not Shri Bhatt has further stated that to the b est of his 
recollection, no politician/Minister was present in the said meeting . 
He has also stated that Shri G.C. Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.) did not 
attend the said meeting being on casual leave and that he was not aware, 
as to whether Shri Raiger h ad returned to Ahmedabad on 27 -02-2002 
evening. He has denied to have contacted Shri Raiger on 27 -02-2002 
evening, at his residence. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has claimed that he used to 
attend the intelligence related meetings called by the Chief Minister. As 
per Shri Bhatt, this meeting was essentially a Law & order review 
323  
 
meeting and the main issues discussed during the said meeting 
revolved around the bandh call given by VHP and ruling BJP as well 
the decision to bring the dead bodies of Godhra victims to 
Ahmed abad. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has also stated that Shri P.C. Pande, 
the then CP, Ahmedabad City had strongly opposed the Govt. 
decision for the transportation of dead bodies of Godhra victims to 
Ahmedabad as the same was likely to lead to serious communal riots 
in Ahmedabad City and these views were supported by Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP. According to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, Shri 
Chakravarthi had conveyed to CM that the available resources of 
Gujarat Police were over stretched to cope with the law & order 
situation that was likely to arise in the wake of bandh call given by 
the VHP on the next day and had expressed his inability to 
supplement the manpower resources of CP, Ahmedabad City.  Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt has stated that as per his recollection, there was no 
meaningful contribution from Shri K. Nityanandam, the then Secretary 
(Home). Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home) and Smt. Swarna 
Kanta Varma, the then acting Chief Secretary. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has 
further stated that DGP and CP, Ahmedabad City tried to impress upon 
the Chief Minister that the bandh call given by VHP on 28 -02-2002, which 
was supported by the ruling party BJP was not a good idea, as far as the 
law & order situation of the State was concerned but the Chief Minister 
did not seem to be convin ced by their arguments and stated that the 
incident like burning of kar -sevaks at Godhra could not be tolerated. 
According to Shri Bhatt, CM impressed upon the gathering as below : - 
 
"That for too long the Gujarat Police had been following the 
principle of  balancing the actions against the Hindus and 
Muslims while dealing with the communal riots in Gujarat. This 
time the situation warranted that the Muslims be taught a 
lesson to ensure that such incidents do not recur ever again. The 
Chief Minister Shri Nar endra Modi expressed the view that the 
emotions were running very high amongst the Hindus  and  it 
was imperative that they be allowed to vent out their anger ".  
According to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, no minutes of the meeting were 
prepared by him or DGP, but he had no knowledge as to whether any 
minutes were kept by CM's office or Home Department. He also claimed 
of making a mention of the said meeting in his movement diary for 
February, 2002. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has further stated that he expressed 
his opinion aga inst the decision of BJP to support the bandh call given by 324  
 
VHP and also the decision of the administration to -bring the dead bodies 
of the victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad City. He also stated that he 
expressed a view that the taking out of the funeral pr ocession of the 
victims in the respective areas would lead to major communal violence in 
Ahmedabad City and other communally sensitive areas across the State.  
 Shri Sanjiv Bhatt stated that he took leave thereafter from Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP, and returned to state IB office in order to 
send alert messages and instructions to the concerned police/intelligence 
units. Subsequent to the aforesaid meeting at CM's residence, Shri Bhatt 
has claimed to have issued several messages to the Police units a s well as 
the field units of the IB with respect to the developing situation including 
the possibility of wide spread communal violence during the Gujarat 
bandh and wherein, he reiterated to different CsP and SSP to take all 
possible measures to prevent un toward incidents in their respective 
jurisdiction. Surprisingly, he  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 406 
 
informed everyone about it but did not inform his own Head of the 
Department i.e. Shr i G.C. Raiger, whom he had allegedly represented in 
the meeting and whose present in the station was very much in his 
knowledge. He has denied to have contacted Shri G.C. Raiger over phone 
in the night of 27 -02-2002 and has stated that he briefed Shri Raig er 
about the said meeting and the deliberations that had taken place, when 
he had attended office on the next day, i.e.  28 -02-2002 morning, at about 
1000 hrs which has been denied by Shri Raiger. Interesting, the call 
details of Govt. mobile phone of Shri  Sanjiv Bhatt show that he was at 
Ahmedabad till 1057 hrs on 28.02.2002. He has further claimed that the 
details of the discussions held during the said meeting were not 
mentioned in any of the official correspondence/reports as he had 
attended the said me eting in the capacity of an intelligence Officer.  
Further, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has claimed that the reports had started 
coming in the office of the State IB regarding the preparations made by 
the cadres of Sangh Parivar to carry out strict enforcement of th e bandh 
call given by them on 28 -02-2002, and that same should be available in 
the records of State IB. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has also claimed to have 
attended the second meeting at CM's residence on 28 -02-2002 at about 
1030 hrs along with Shri G.C. Raiger, th e then Addl. DG (Int), in which 
325  
 
the deployment of manpower during the Gujarat bandh was discussed to 
monitor the developing situation and that this meeting was also attended 
by Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP, Shri Anil Mukim, the then Addl. 
PS to CM, L ate Ashok Bhatt, the then Health Minister and Shri I.K. 
Jadeja, the then Urban Development Minister. Shri Bhatt has further 
stated that on the conclusion of the said meeting, the Chief Minister had 
instructed DGP that Late Ashok Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja would be 
assisting the police in monitoring the situation and that all necessary 
assistance must be rendered to the Ministers. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has also 
stated that CM had not specifically instructed as to how the Ministers 
would assist the police. Furthe r, according to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the issue 
relating to the requisitioning of the Army was also discussed on the basis 
of the suggestions given by DGP and Addl. DG (Int.) , but the Chief 
Minister seemed to be reluctant and was of the view that they should wait 
and watch, as to how the situation developed and not rush for the 
requisitioning of Army.  
 According to Shri Bhatt, he returned to the Police Bhavan and went 
to his chamber on the second floor, but shortly thereafter went to DGP's 
chamber around 1100 hrs to obtain his signature for requisitioning 
additional forces and found Late Ashok Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja seated 
in his chamber, where everyone took tea. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has further 
stated that sometime later, he visited State Control Room on the first floor 
of Police Bhavan, to collect some documents and saw Shri I.K.Jadeja and 
his staff members occupying the chamber of Dy.SP State Control Room. 
Finding this arrangement to be little odd and inconvenient, with the 
permission of the DGP he shifted S hri Jadeja and his staff to the chamber 
of Shri P.C. Thakur, the then IGP, who was on leave. Later during the day, 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt came to know that Shri Jadeja had left the Police 
Bhavan, However, as per Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, Shri Jadeja did not interfere 
with the working of State Police Control Room on 28 -02-2002, or 
thereafter. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has also claimed that he came to know from 
his staff later that Late Ashok Bhatt was stationed in Ahmedabad City 
Police Control Room on 28 -02-2002.  
 On being ques tioned, as to whether deliberations in CM's meeting 
or the developments in the Control Rooms were mentioned by him in any 
of the reports submitted to the senior officers at any stage, Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt has claimed that he had attended the said meeting alon g with the 
DGP and Addl. DG (Int.) as a Staff Officer and as such there was no 
necessity to submit any report to them. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has claimed to 
have received information about a mob attack on Gulberg Society around 
1130 hrs on 28 -02-2002, and he ha d deputed PI Shri Bharwad of 326  
 
Ahmedabad Regional Office located in Meghaninagar to go to Gulberg 
Society, to report on the developing situation and inform the State IB. 
According to Shri Bhatt, he had conveyed these developments to DGP and 
Addl.  DG (Int.) p ersonally. In view of the fact that Late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -
MP was residing in the Gulberg Society, he (Sanjiv Bhatt) telephonically 
conveyed the details about the developing situation to the Chief Minister 
directly. However, he does not recollect, as to whe ther he had spoken to 
the Chief Minister over landline or over the mobile phone of Shri O .P. 
Singh, PA to CM. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has stated that he attended another 
meeting at CM's residence on 28.02.2002 afternoon for the assessment of 
the ongoing situatio n, which was attended to by ACS (Home), DGP, Addl. 
DG (Int.), and Secretary (Home) , in which the Chief Minister had agreed 
to send a formal requisition to Govt. of India for deployment of Army. He 
has claimed that he briefed the Chief Minister about the on going 
developments at Gulberg Society and also about the threat to the life of 
Late Ahesan Jafri and other residents of the Gulberg Society Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt has gone to the extent of claiming that the Chief Minister took him 
aside after the meeting and in formed him that he had learnt that Late 
Ahesan Jafri had  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 407 
 
opened fire on Hindus during earlier communal riots . According to Shri 
Sanjiv Bha tt, the Chief Minister asked him to dig out all the facts 
pertaining to earlier instances, wherein Late Ahesan Jafri had opened fire 
during the past communal riots. Shri Bhatt claimed that he conveyed 
these facts to Shri G.C. Raiger, the then Add. DG (lnt.). However, Sh ri 
Bhatt has stated that he could not check/collect this information as he 
remained busy with certain urgent matters connected with the riots. Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt has denied having submitted any report to his department 
and claimed that he had attended this meeting as a Staff Officer to the 
DGP or AddI DG (Int.), which is incorrect as there was no post of Staff 
Officer to Addl. DG (Int.).  
 On being questioned, as to why did he not appear as a witness in 
response to a public notice issued by SIT on 11 -03-2008,  he claimed that 
he did not disclose the same to anyone, as it would not have been 
appropriate on his part to divulge any information that he was privy  to as 
an Intelligence Officer unless he was under a legal obligation to do so. He 
327  
 
has also stated that h e did not file any affidavit or appeared before any 
commission or any other body enquiring into the communal riots of 2002, 
because he was not asked by the Govt. of Gujarat, DGP or AddI.DG (Int.) 
to do so. He has denied knowledge as to whether the alleged instruction 
given by the Chief Minister were passed on to the field units by any of the 
officers, who had attended the meeting on 27 -02-2002. The stand taken 
by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt is not acceptable on account of the fact that firstly it 
was essentially a la w & order meeting, in which many civilian officers were 
present and there was nothing secret about it. Furthermore, Shri Bhatt 
has various opportunities and legal obligations to disclose these facts, if 
true, firstly to Shri R.B. Sreekumar, the then Addl. DG (Int.), who had 
asked him to provide any oral and documentary relevant fact to be 
included in his affidavit relating to riots Incidents on behalf of State IB 
required to be filed before Nanavati Commission,  
Secondly, Nanavati Commission a legally constituted body under 
Commission of Inquiry Act had issued a public notice calling upon any 
one having knowledge about the incident of issues involved before it, to 
file an affidavit and furnish information , but Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not file 
any affidavit. Thirdly, SIT, legally constituted by the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of India had also issued a public notice on 11.04.2008 calling upon 
the people to come forward and give information relating to the riots. but 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt conveniently did not come forward. Fourthly. another 
opportunity was given to him in November, 2009, to make a statement 
during the course of inquiry ordered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
India, but Shri Sanjiv Bhatt took the plea that it would not be 
professionally appropri ate on his part to divulge the exact nature of 
discussion that took place during the said meeting, unless he was duty 
bound to disclose the same under legal obligation.  
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, on his own and without being summoned 
appeared before the IO on 25 -03-2011, i.e. two days after the recording of 
his statement, along with one constable named Shri K.D. Panth and 
requested that his (Bhatt's) further statement should be recorded. In his 
further statement, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt mentioned the names of two 
Assist ant Intelligence Officers (A IOs) namely, Shri Shailesh Raval and 
Shri K.D. Panth, who used to accompany him to most of the meetings. He 
has further stated that subsequent to the recording of his statement on 
21 & 22.03.2011, he had been able to recollect t hat Shri K.D. Panth had 
followed him to CM's residence with the files in his staff car from DGP's 
office, whereas he himself had accompanied DGP Shri K. Chakravarthi in 
the latter's staff car. He has also stated that Shri K.D. Panth returned 
with him in hi s car to Police Bhavan and remained in the office till late in 328  
 
the night and attended to urgent official work. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt also 
informed that then Shri Tarachand Yadav, was his driver who is presently 
attached to Shri V.K. Mall, Joint Director, Gujar at Police Academy, Karai, 
Gandhinagar. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt also disclosed that, as DCI (Security), he 
was using the Govt. mobile phone no. 9825049398.  
 During the course of further investigation seven senior 
administrative and police officers namely, Shri As hok Narayan, the then 
ACS (Home), Shri P.K. Mishra, the then Principal Secretary to CM, Shri 
K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP, Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP Ahmedabad 
City, Shri Anil Mukim, the then Addl. PS to CM, Shri K. Nityanandam, the 
then Secretary (Home ) and Shri Prakash S. Shah, the then Addl. Secretary 
(L&O), who had been earlier examined during 2009 -10 have categorically 
stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) was not present in 
the said meeting held at CM's residence on 27.02.2002 nigh t. During the 
earlier inquiry, three participants of this meeting namely Shri 
Nityanandam, Shri Anil Mukim and Smt. Swarna Kanta Verma were not 
asked this question while three others namely Shri Ashok Narayan, Shri 
P.C.Pande and Shri P. K. Mishra had state d that they did not recollect. 
Shri P.S. Shah had not been examined during the inquiry. However, Shri 
K. Chakravarthi had  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 408 
 
stated at that stage also that Shri Bhatt was not present in this meeting. 
They have also confirmed that no Minister/Politician was present in the 
said meeting.  
Smt. Swarna Kant a Varma, being ACS (Health & Family Deptt.) and 
the then acting Chief Secretar y was never posted in the Home Department 
and therefore, she did not know Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security). 
On being shown the photograph of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, she has stated that 
she cannot recollect having ever met or seen him in any meeting. 
According to Smt. Swarna Kanta Varma, the Chief Minister had stated in 
the said meeting that incident in Godhra was very unfortunate and it 
should be dealt with a heavy hand. She also does not recollect having 
seen any Cabinet Minister in the said meeting. All the participants of the 
meeting held on 27.02.2002 night, have denied that CM had uttered any 
words on the lines that Gujarat Police had been following the principle of 
balancing the actions against the Hindus and Muslims while dealing with 
329  
 
the communa l riots in Gujarat and that the situation warranted that 
Muslims be taught a lesson to ensure that such incident do not recur ever 
again and that the emotions were running very high amongst the Hindus 
and they be allowed to vent their anger.  
 There is unan imity amongst all the participants of the said meeting 
that no Minister/politician was present in the meeting. Shri Bhatt has 
contended that Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP Ahmedabad City had 
strongly opposed the Government's decision regarding transportation  of 
the dead bodies to Ahmedabad City, as the same was likely to lead to 
communal riots and that his views were supported by Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP. His version stands contradicted by Shri P.C. 
Pande, the then CP, Ahmedabad City, who had stated  that the sum and 
the substance of the meeting was that the dead bodies were being brought 
to Ahmedabad City with a view to facilitate the relatives of the deceased 
to identify and claim the same.  
 Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP has clearly stated that  the 
decision of the Govt. To bring the dead bodies of Godhra victims at 
Ahmedabad City, was not opposed by anyone on the ground that a large 
number of victims belonged to Ahmedabad and nearby places, which were 
easily approachable, from Ahmedabad. This wo uld go to show that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt was giving an imaginary account of the deliberations of the 
meeting and did not know as to what exactly transpired there. Further, it 
has been contended by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt that both DGP and CP, 
Ahmedabad City had tri ed to impress upon the Chief Minister that the 
band call given by the VHP on 28 -02-2002, which was supported by the 
ruling party BJP was not a good idea as far as the Law & order situation 
of the State was concerned and that the Chief Minister was not conv inced 
by their arguments. In this regard, Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP 
has stated that in the night of 27.02.2002, he did not know that the bandh 
call given by the VHP was supported by the ruling party BJP and as such 
there was no question of any suc h opposition by him. Shri P.C. Pande has 
also stated that on 27.02.2002, he did not know that the bandh was 
supported by the BJP and came to know about it only on 28.02.2002, 
through newspaper reports. All the participants of the meeting have 
stated that t he Chief Minister had expressed the apprehension that the 
Godhra incident was very serious and bound to affect the public at large, 
as a result of which there could be repercussions and therefore, adequate 
bandobast was needed to avoid any untoward inciden t. 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has claimed that he mentioned the fact of 
having attended the said meeting on 27 -02-2002 night in his 330  
 
movement diary. However, the State IB has reported that no such 
diary was being submitted by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, Shri G.C. Raiger, the  
then Addl. DG (Int.) has stated that there was no such system of 
submitting any monthly movement diary by DC and that Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt had never submitted any such diary. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt have 
claimed to have briefed Shri G.C, Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.) on 
28.02.2002, at about 1000 hrs about the alleged meeting held by the 
Chief Minister and also about the illegal instructions given by the 
latter. This claim is absolutely false and is contradicted from the call 
detail records of the Govt. mobile ph one no. 9825049398 of Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt, which show that the location of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was 
at Memnagar, Ahmedabad till 10:57:43 hrs on 28.02.2002. Further, 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has claimed that he did not submit any report 
about the meeting held by the Ch ief Minister at his residence on 
27.02.2002 night, as he attended the meeting as a Staff Officer to 
DGP/Addl. DG (Int.). This contention put forward by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
is absurd because there was no post of Staff Officer to Addl DG (Int.) 
and Shri K. Cha kravarthi has denied that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was 
posted as Staff Officer to DGP, as the Staff Officer was of the rank of 
Dy. SP and not SP Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has contended that he did not 
file affidavit nor appeared as a witness before the SIT in response to  
a public notice issued by the SIT, as it would not have been 
appropriate on his part  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 409 
 
to divulge any information that he was privy to as an intelligence 
officer unless he was under a legal obligation to do so. In this 
connection, it would not be out of place to mention here that 
assuming for the time being that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt attended the 
alleged meeting of 27.02.2002  the same was essentia lly a law & order 
meeting attended by the various officials of State Administration and 
therefore the question of oath of secrecy or application of the Official 
Secrets Act does not arise because it was neither a secret meeting 
nor would the revelation of the contents of the said meeting 
jeopardized the public interest. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has used the 
weapon of the Official Secrets Act only as a pretext with a view to 
justify a long delay of nine years just because an official of the 
intelligence unit attend ed a law & order meeting, the same does not 
331  
 
became a secret meeting for which a privilege of secrecy is being 
claimed by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt. In any case, Nanavat i Commission and 
SIT have been set up under the provisions of law of the land and all 
the citize ns/ officials are legally bound to divulge the information 
available with them which are relevant to the terms of reference/ 
crimes of the Commission being investigation by SIT.  
 In view of this, the explanation put forward by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
does not h old good Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had gone to the extent of saying 
that he learnt from the other staff that Late Ashok Bhatt was 
stationed in Ahmedabad City Police Control Room, which has no 
value, whatsoever, being the hearsay evidence. The claim of Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt that he had opposed the bringing of dead bodies to 
Ahmedabad from Godhra, is belied from the fact that all the 
participants of the said meeting have categorically stated that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt did not attend the said meeting . 
 Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has s pecifically claimed that he had 
accompanied the DGP Shri K. Chakravarthi to the residence of the 
Chief Minister in the night of 27.02:2002 in latter's staff car, which 
has been denied by Shri K. Chakravarthi. The statement of Shri K. 
Chakravarthi has been supported by the entry made by Shri K. 
Chakravarthi in his staff car log book written by him on the relevant 
date in his hand, which show that two persons (1+1), i.e. DGP and his 
PSO used the car on 27.02.2002. The version of Shri K. Chakravarthi 
is furthe r corroborated by his PSOs namely Shri Dilip Ahir and Shri 
Dharmpal Yadav, who have categorically stated that Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt never accompanied the DGP in his staff car .   
It is a fact that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did send four wireless messages 
on 27 -02-2002 to all the jurisdictional officers to take all precautionary 
measures to prevent communal riots as Godhra incident was likely to 
have State wide repercussions. These wireless messages were sent by him 
as DCI (Communal) as Shri P.B. Upadhyay , the then DCI (Communal) 
was on casual leave on that day i.e. 27 -02-2002. However, he had 
resumed duty in the evening. Significantly, on 28 -02-2002, all the 
concerned wireless messages were sent by Shri P.B. Upadhyay, the then 
DCI (Communal), who was deali ng with the subject. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt as 
DCI (Security) had also sent a fax message on 28 -02-2002, to Home 
Secretary, Gandhinagar with information to PS to CM , PS to MoS (Home), 
DGP and Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City, in which he had 
intimated abo ut a Hindu mob attack on Gulberg Society resulting into 
death of atleast 18 persons including Late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP and its 332  
 
family members and the attack was continuing. Shri Bhatt had expressed 
his apprehension that this incident could have State wide ramifications. 
Though no time had been mentioned on this message, yet it appears that 
this fax message was sent only after the killings had taken place and the 
Gulberg Society had been set on fire. In all probability this message had 
been sent on the basis  of the fax message sent by PI C.J. Bharwad, the 
then PI, Ahmedabad City Regional State IB office at 1700 hrs.  
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has further contended that in view of the fact that 
Late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP was residing in Gulberg Society, he had 
telephoni cally conveyed the details directly to the Chief Minister either on 
landline or on the mobile phone of Shri O.P. Singh, PA to CM. However, 
he has not been able to specify on which telephone he rang up the Chief 
Minister. Shri O.P. Singh has denied that he received any call from Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt. The call details of Gandhinagar tower are not available as 
the same had not been requisitioned by Shri Rahul Sharma, the then SP, 
during investigation of the riot cases Notably there is no practice in 
Gujarat of SP  level officers speaking directly to CM over phone. Further, 
Shri G.C. Raiger the then Addl. DG (Int.), who was very much in office on 
28.02.2002, has stated that this was totally false and that Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt had never informed him about it.  
Shri C.J.  Bharwad, the then PI, State IB, Ahmedabad Region has 
stated that on 28.02.2002, on the basis of information collected by him 
during the riots, he had gone to Gulberg Society Meghaninagar of his own 
and passed on the various information reports collected b y him  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 410  
 
to State IB Control Room. He has further stated that around 1215 hrs on 
28-02-2002, he had sent a message to State IB Control Room that since 
Musl ims reside in Gulberg Society in Meghaninagar area, a strict watch 
should be kept there. He has contradicted the statement made by Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security), and has denied to have any 
telephonic discussions with him about the situation in  Gulberg Society in 
as much as the subject concerned the "Communal" Desk of IB was being 
looked after by Shri P.B. Upadhyay, the then DCI(Communal). He has 
further stated to have passed on a message at 1450 hrs on 28.02.2002, 
that a mob of 3000 rioters had  surrounded Gulberg Society. On 28 -02-
2002 itself, he had passed on another message at 1700 hrs that a mob of 
333  
 
5000 rioters had surrounded and set fire to the Gulberg Society, in which 
several persons including Late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP had been burnt alive 
and that police deployment was required. The version of Shri Bharwad 
belies the testimony of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) , who has 
claimed that he had given directions to Shri Bharwad to go to the Gulberg 
Society and give the latest updates a nd that Shri Bharwad was in 
constant touch with him.  
 Investigation further revealed that the headquarters of State 
Intelligence Bureau is located at Gandhinagar and is headed by an Addl. 
DG, assisted by IGP (Security) , DIG (Political & Communal) and three  
Deputy Commissioners of Intelligence and other officers and supporting 
staff. Besides State IB, there are intelligence units headed by Inspectors/ 
Dy SsP working independently in the Districts. The State IB has been 
entrusted with the duties of collection  of intelligence in respect of 
maintenance of law & order including communal intelligence in Gujarat 
State. In brief, the functions, of the State IB relate to collection and 
collation of information regarding political, industrial and other similar 
develop ment in the State, verification of antecedents, protection and 
security of the VIP's, watch over anti -national activities, movement of 
foreigners and all other matters pertaining to the internal security, 
collection of intelligence regarding all types of c ommunal activities and to 
keep the Govt. informed of all these activities from time to time.  
 In February, 2002, Shri G.C. Raiger was posted as Addl. DG (Int.) 
and was assisted by Shri O.P. Mathur, IGP (Security & Admn.). In 
addition, there was another po st of IGP (Political & Communal), which 
was lying vacant due to the death of Shri S.Kumar in January, 2002. 
There were three SP rank officers out of which, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was 
posted as DCI (Security), Shri P.B. Upadhyay as DCI (Political & 
Communal) and  the third post was DCI (Admn.) which was lying vacant. 
It has further come to light that Shri G.C. Raiger was on casual leave from 
26.02.2002 to 28.02.2002 and was away to Rajasthan, but returned on 
27.02.2002 evening. Shri P.B. Upadyay, the then DCI (Com munal) was 
on leave from 26.02.2002 onwards to arrange for sacred thread ceremony 
of his grandson fixed for 01.03.2002. However, Shri O.P. Mathur, IGP had 
called him up on 27.02.2002 afternoon, informed him about the Godhra 
incident and instructed to resum e duties immediately. Accordingly, Shri 
Upadyay had resumed duties on 27.02.2002 evening. However, in his 
absence, his work was being looked after by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, who was 
the only other SP rank officer in the State IB.  334  
 
 Shri G.C. Raiger has stated th at on his return to Ahmedabad on 27 -
02-2002, he had come to know about the Godhra incident and had 
telephonically informed DGP Shri K. Chakravarthi on 27.02.2002 evening 
that he would cut short his leave and come to Gandhinagar, if necessary, 
to which the DGP asked him to join on 28.02.2002. Shri Raiger has denied 
having been informed by the DGP about the meeting called at CM's 
residence on 27.02.2002 late in the night. Shri Raiger denied having 
received any information about the meeting from either the Sta te IB 
Control Room, State Control Room or even Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then 
DCI (Security). Shri O.P. Mathur has also denied that he received any 
such information about a meeting called at CM's residence on 27.02.2002 
night. Shri P.B. Upadhyay, the then DCI  (Communal), who had resumed 
the duties on 27.02.2002 evening, and used to look after Communal and 
Political section and was the concerned officer to be associated with the 
said meeting, had also no information about the said meeting thereby 
suggesting tha t no one from the intelligence was required to attend the 
said meeting .  
Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP has stated that he had gone to 
studios of Door -Darshan, Ahmedabad City on 27 -02-2002 late in the 
evening, for the telecast of an appeal to the gener al public to maintain 
communal harmony and peace, when he received a message from State 
Control Room that CM had called for a meeting at his residence at 
Gandhinagar around 2230 hrs. Shri Chakravarthi has stated that he 
straight away went to CM's residence  at Gandhinagar and reached there 
a little earlier and waited as CM had not arrived from Godhra by 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 411 
 
that time. According to Shri Charkravarti, Smt. Swarna Kanta Varma, the 
then acting CS, Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home), Shri P.C. 
Pande, the then CP, Ahmedabad City and Shri K. Nityanandam, the then 
Secretary (Home) arrived only subsequently.  Shri Chakravarthi has 
categorically denied having given any instructions to Shri Sanjiv -Bhatt, 
the then DCI (Security) to attend the aforesaid meeting. H e has further 
stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not accompany him to CM's residence 
in his car from DG's office, as he (DGP) did not visit office at that time.  
He has also stated that in case Shri Raiger was available at Ahmedabad, 
he would have given ins tructions to State Control Room to call him. 
According to Shri Chakravarthi even otherwise, Shri O.P. Mathur, the 
335  
 
then IGP (Admn. & Sec.) was available and could have been called to 
attend the meeting rather than asking Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, a junior officer 
of SP level to attend the said meeting.  
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) has named two A IOs 
namely Shri K.D. Panth and Shri Shailesh Raval, who used to 
accompany him to such meetings along with the files. After Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt's further stateme nt was recorded at his own request on 
25-03-2011, he insisted that Shri K.D Panth, who was accompanying 
him and was waiting outside, should also be examined. He Stressed 
that Shri Panth should be examined in his presence. However, Shri 
Bhatt was informed t hat Shri K.D. Panth would be called on a date 
convenient to the IO and examined. Accordingly, Shri Panth was 
informed on 04 -04-20 11, to attend SIT office on 05 -04-2011, for his 
examination.  
Shri K.D. Panth in his examination has stated that he was on 
casu al leave on 27 -02-2002. Further, he has denied that he followed 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) to CM's residence on 27 -
02-2002 night. However, he has stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had 
called him to his residence on 24 -03-2011 night and informed  that 
he was going to make a statement before the SIT that he (K.D. Panth) 
had gone to attend a meeting at CM's residence on 27 -02-2002 night, 
and that he (Panth) had been called at State IB office and be ready 
with the files for the said meeting. Shri San jiv Bhatt further informed 
Shri Panth that he should accompany him to SIT office on 25 -03-
2011, and make a statement on these lines . 
During his examination, Shri Panth further stated that he has 
contacted Shri Sanjiv Bhatt over his landline telephone no.27 455117 
from mobile no. 8140657775 (belonging to one of his friends) after he was 
called for examination scheduled for 05 -04-2011. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt called 
him at his residence on 04 -04-2011 at 2030 hrs. At his residence, Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt informed Shri Pan th that he has made a statement to the 
SIT that he (Bhatt) had accompanied DGP. Shri K. Chakravarthi in his 
official car to CM's office from DGP's office on 27 -02-2002 night and that 
he (Shri Panth) had followed him in his (Shri Sanjiv Bhatt's) staff car a long 
with the files. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt asked Shri Panth to make a statement 
accordingly.  
Subsequently, Shri K.D. Panth lodged a complaint against Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt with the local police to the effect that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
had influenced, detained, put sev ere pressure and compelled him to 
sign an affidavit containing false/wrong and incorrect facts, in 336  
 
pursuance of which a case no. I CR No.149/2011 was registered u/s 
189, 193, 195, 341, 342 IPC with Ghatlodia police station, 
Ahmedabad City, Gujarat State. S hri Sanjiv Bhatt has since been 
arrested in this case and the matter is under investigation. In view 
of this, no reliance can be placed upon the version of Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt.  
This conduct of Shri Sanjiv Bhat, in arranging, prompting and 
controlling the wit ness to corroborate his statement is highly 
suspicious and undesirable. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt also contacted Shri 
Shailesh Raval on 28 -03-2011/29 -03-2011, over mobile phone 
no.9825688223 of one Shri NJ. Chauhan, a clerk in CM's Security 
and informed him that h e would be called by SIT for his examination. 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt also asked Shri Shailesh Raval that he had worked 
with him in Security Branch for a long time and was aware that he 
(Sanjiv Bhatt) used to attend meetings, to which Shri Raval reacted 
by sayin g that he had accompanied him in Border Security Nodal 
Committee meetings, which used to deal with the Border Security 
only. Shri Raval also informed Shri Sanjiv Bhatt that he never worked 
in the Communal Branch and was not aware of anything about it. 
Shri  Sanjiv Bhatt thereafter disconnected the phone. Shri Shailesh 
Raval, PI later sent a complaint in writing to the Chairman, SIT that 
he feared reprisal from Shri Sanjiv Bhatt as he had refused to support 
the false claims of Shri Bhatt. This is yet another attempt on the part 
of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to tutor a witness to depose in a particular 
manner so as to support the statement made by him, which further 
makes his claim of having attended the meeting at CM's residence 
on 27 -02-2002 false.

Shri Tarachand B. Yadav, driver constable in SRP Group -XII, who 
had been dismissed from service on the charge of getting employment in 
Gujarat Police on the basis of false and forged certificate, has stated that 
he used to drive the staff car allotted to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI 
(Security) during February -March, 2002. However, he does not remember 
the registration number of the staff car. Shri Yadav could not give the  
name of Personal Security Officer of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI 
(security). However, he has stated that he recollects that Shri Sanjiv 
337  
 
Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) had gone to CM's residence in a three star 
car with either DGP or some ADGP from Pol ice Bhavan and that he had 
followed him in his staff car, in which Shri K.D. Panth, the then A IO, State 
IB sat with some files. He has also stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then 
DCI (Security) returned after about 25 minutes and he took him to Police 
Bha van, where he worked till midnight i.e. 0030 hrs and then drove him 
back to his residence at Ahmedabad. Shri Yadav could not say as to 
whether Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) accompanied DGP or 
some ADGP rank officer. He has denied knowledge, as  to whether Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt went inside CM's office to attend the meeting or not, as he 
was waiting outside. He has also stated that on 28 -02-2002, Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt reached Police Bhavan at about 0900 hrs and worked in his office 
and did not go out to a ttend any meeting at CM's house. On 28 -02-2002, 
he has stated that he started from Gandhinagar dropped Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt at his residence at about 1900 hrs. However, he could not recollect 
the details of the various events of 1st, 2nd & 3rd March, 2002 due to 
passage of time.  
The version of Shri Tarachand B. Yadav is contradicted by Shri K.D. 
Panth, who has denied to have followed Shri Sanjiv Bhatt in his staff car 
driven by Shri Tarachand Yadav.  Besides that he is an unreliable witness 
due  to his background. He has been dismissed from service due to his 
own misconduct. Moreover, he has admitted to h ave gone to the residence 
of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) on 17 -04-2011 afternoon, for 
getting a briefing before making a statemen t to SIT. The call details of his 
mobile phone clearly show that he was in touch with Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, 
the then DCI (Security). Even when he was being interrogated in SIT office, 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was repeatedly contacting him over his mobile phone to 
which he did not respond. In addition, the version of Shri Tarachand 
Yadav about the movements of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt on 28 -02-2002, are 
proved to be false in as much as Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not come to 
Gandhinagar at 0900 hrs, as the call detail records of h is official mobile 
phone show his location at Ahmedabad City till 1057 hrs. Shri Tarachand 
Yadav further contradicts the version of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, who claims to 
have attended a meeting on 28 -02-2002 at 1030 hrs, at CM's residence. 
The overall impressio n left in the matter is that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has 
introduced him as a false witness with a view to corroborate his own false 
version about having attended a meeting at CM's residence on 27 -02-
2002 night, whereas in fact Shri Tarachand Yadav does not recol lect 
anything about the events of 27 -02-2002 onwards. Moreover, he is a 
motivated witness, who has got an axe to grind against the Govt. on 338  
 
account of his dismissal from service.  In view of this no reliance can be 
placed upon his evidence.  
During further investigation, PSOs of the then DGP Shri K. 
Chakravarthi were examined.  PSI Dilip Jivaram Ahir and Head constable 
Dharampal Jagaram Yadav stated that they had never seen Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt sitting in the vehicle along with DGP.  
Shri G.C. Raiger, the then A ddl. DC, (Int.) has stated that Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt was never posted as Staff Officer to Addl. DG (Int.), because there 
is no post like that in the State IB.  Further, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt could not 
have been a Staff Officer to the DGP, as Late V.S. Shinde, Dy. SP was 
posted as Staff Officer to the DGP. Shri Raiger has further stated that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt used to accompany him in the meetings called by the Chief 
Minister sometime, but was normally made to wait outside with the 
relevant files/information and did not join the meetings. Shri Raiger was 
unable to recollect any meeting called by the Chief Minister, which Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt attended along with him. Shri Raiger has further stated that 
on 28 -02-2002, he did come to know about the meeting called by the Chi ef 
Minister at his residence on 27 -02-2002, but Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not 
inform him of having attended the said meeting and also about its agenda 
or the matters discussed in the said meeting.  
Shri R. B. Sreekumar formerly ADGP Intelligence, in his intervi ew 
given to the Star Hindi News Channel at 12.35 hrs on 22.04.2011 has 
stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, DCI (Security) had never informed him 
about having attended a meeting at CM's residenc e on 27.02.2002. He 
has further stated that at the time of filing an  affidavit before Nanavati 
Shah Inquiry Commission, he had asked all the officers of State IB to 
provide him with the relevant  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 413 
 
information and documents  in respect of Godhra riots but Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt did not give him any information about the said meting. According 
to Shri Sreekumar, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was handling security portfolio and 
communal portfolio was being looked after by another officer. Shri 
Sreekumar has also stated in the interview that it was a normal procedure 
that if a junior officer had attended a meeting on behalf of senior, he was 
required to submit a report to his superior and that Shri G.C. Raigar, the 
339  
 
then ADGP (Int) should be asked  about it. As already stated above, Shri 
Raigar has denied having received any information/report from Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt in this regard.  
The call detail records of the Govt. mobile phone 
no.9825049398, allotted to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt show that on 27-02- 
2002, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt remained at Ahmedabad till about 1120 hrs 
and returned to Ahmedabad at 1925 hrs. He attended to various calls 
till 2040 hrs and thereafter, there is no record of any calls made or 
received by him. However, the call details re cord do not indicate that 
he was going towards Gandhinagar on or at 2040 hrs. Further, on 28 -
02-2002, as per call details the location of Shri Bhatt was noticed at 
Ahmedabad till 10:57:43 hrs and again at Ahmedabad at 2056 hrs. 
The claim of Shri Sanjiv Bha tt that he had attended a meeting at 
CM's residence on 28 -02-2002, at 1030 hrs is, therefore, proved to 
be false and incorrect. CM's residence is at Gandhinagar, more than 
25 KMs from his residence at Memnagar, Ahmedabad, and it normally 
takes 30 to 45 min utes to reach Gandhinagar. His further claim that 
he had seen Late Ashok Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja, the then Ministers 
in the DGP's office at about 1100 hrs on 28 -02-2002, is also belied 
from the call detail records in as much as the location of the mobil e 
phone of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was at Prerna Tower, Vastrapur -1, 
Ahmedabad, which happened to be at a distance of 1.5 Kms 
approximately from his residence and by any stretch of imagination 
Shri Bhatt could not have reached Police Bhavan, Gandhinagar before 
1130 hrs.  
Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home) has stated that a meeting 
was held by the Chief Minister in the morning of 28 -02-2002, which was 
attended by acting Chief Secretary, DGP and Addl. DG (Int.) and the 
matter relating to the calling of Army was  also discussed, but no decision 
was taken and it was decided to watch the situation. He has categorically 
denied that Late Ashok Bhatt and Shri I.K. Jadeja, Ministers had attended 
the said meeting. The claim of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt that he had attended the 
said meeting at 1030 hrs at CM's residence is proved to be false from the 
location of his mobile phone, which was at Prerna Tower, Vastrapur -I, 
Ahmedabad City at 10:57:43 hrs. Moreover, his contention that the 
aforesaid two Ministers were present in the sai d meeting is proved to be 
false from the statement of Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home), 
who has categorically stated that they were not present in the said 
meeting.  340  
 
As regards the alleged utterances made by the Chief Minister in 
the meeting called o n 27 -02-2002 night at his residence, it may be 
mentioned here that Shri R.B. Sreeku mar, the then Addl. DG (Int.) 
had claimed that Shri K.Chakravarthi, the then DGP had informed 
him on 28 -02-2002 that the Chief Minister had said in the meeting 
that “ KOMI HULLADO MA TAME POLICE BARABARI KARO CHO, TAME 
BE HINDU NE PAKDO TO TAME BE MUSALMANO NE PAN PARDO CHO, 
HAVE EM NAHI CHALE. HINDUONO GUSSO UTTARWA DO .” ( In 
communal riots police takes action against Hindus and Muslims on 
one to one basis. This will no t do now -allow Hindus to give vent to 
their anger.) Shri Chakravarthi as denied that he held any such talks 
with Shri R.B. Sreekumar. Even otherwise, the version of Shri R.B. 
Sreekumar becomes hearsay. However, on the other hand Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt, who insi sts that he was in the said meeting, has alleged that 
the Chief Minister had said “that for too long the Gujarat Police had 
been following the principle of balancing the actions against the 
Hindus and Muslims while dealing with the communal riots in 
Gujara t. This time the situation warranted that the Muslims be taught a 
lesson  to ensure that such incidents do not recur ever again. The Chief 
Minister Shri Narendra Modi expressed the view that the emotions were 
running very high amongst the Hindus and it was imperative that they be 
allowed to vent out their anger”. Assuming for the time being that the 
Chief Minister did say so, there is a material difference between the two 
versions in as much as Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has tried to improve his version 
by way of add ition “that this time the situation warranted, that the 
Muslims be taught a lesson to ensure that such incidents do not recur 
ever again” Since there is no independent corroboration of the version of 
either Shri R.B. Sreekumar or Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, no reli ance can be placed 
on either of them.  It is relevant to mention here that the Ld. Amicus 
Curiae has agreed with the findings of SIT that the aforesaid statement of 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar was not admissible in evidence.  
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has not been able to give any satisfactory 
explanation that when he was in possession of plethora of 
information and was an eyewitness to some of the important events,  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 414 
then w hy did he not file an affidavit before Nanavati Commission and 
also did not appear as a witness in response to the Govt. circular 
before any legal authority. He does not explain as to why he did not 
341  
 
respond to a public notice issued by SIT on 11 -04-2008. H owever, on 
21/22 —03-2011, when he made a statement, u/s 161 Cr.PC before 
the SIT, it is not understood as to by whom and how the claimed 
secrecy was waived. His silence for a period of more than nine years 
without any proper explanation appears to be suspi cious and gives 
an impression that he is trying to manipulate the things to his 
personal advantage to settle his service matters . 
During the course of further investigation a complaint was received 
from Shri Dharmesh P. Shukla, an accused in I CR No.67/2002 of 
Meghaninagar P.S. (Gulberg Society Case), who is facing trial, in which 
he contended that there was no justification to record the statement of 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt on account of the following reasons: - 
(i) That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, IPS is known t o be a police officer of dubious 
character facing several criminal cases of serious nature and 
whenever he wants a favour from the Govt., he creates a situation 
whereby the Govt. is compelled to help him.  
(ii)  Thai Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, who had not even whis pered about any such 
meeting in the past contemporaneously, surprisingly came out with 
a new theory that he was a part of the meeting.  
(iii) That this sudden stand taken by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt after nine years 
of silence and his insistence that his statement  be recorded only 
after an offence is registered, is at the behest of some person's with 
vested interests.  
(iv) That it is known to almost everyone in Gujarat that Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt is famous for his pressure tactics to get illegal favours.  
 
Since the alle gations leveled by the complainant were serious, a 
communication was sent to the Govt. to make available the details of all 
complaints/pending inquiries/prosecutions/departmental proceedings 
etc. against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt.  A detailed reply has been receiv ed from 
the Govt. of Gujarat, which shows that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has faced a 
number of departmental inquiries and he was granted three promotions 
to the rank of Junior Administrative Grade, Selection Grade and DIG 
Grade on one day i.e. 21 -09-2007, after dr opping of three departmental 
inquiries pending against him vide orders dated 06 -08-2005, 03 -09-2005 
& 24 -07-2006. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, who is eligible for the IGP grade has not 
been promoted because of the departmental inquiries and criminal cases 
pending ag ainst him.  A charge -sheet served upon him on 29 -12-2010, 342  
 
for irregularities in police recruitment under his Chairmanship as SP, 
Banaskantha is still pending.  
It has further come to light that while handling a law and order 
situation during his posting as ASP Jamnagar in the year 1990, Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt committed police atrocities on peaceful and innocent 
villagers belonging to a particular community at a place called Jam 
Jodhpur. In the beatings by police, one person was killed. The victims 
included a preg nant woman, two assistant engineers of Irrigation, 
department and one Circle officer of Revenue Department. Shri Bhatt 
applied provisions of draconian law TADA against the innocent persons 
and arrested 140 individuals under this Act. Due to public pressure , the 
Government got an inquiry conducted from a retired Judicial officer into 
the incident and Shri Bhatt was found guilty of (a) misuse of TADA (b) 
police atrocities and (c) unnecessary imposition of curfew for 70 hours 
leading to hardship and harassment  to the people.  
It has also come to light that the criminal case relating to death of a 
person due to police atrocities in the incident was investigated by State 
CID (Crime) against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt and others. On completion of 
investigation, the I0 sough t prosecution sanction from the Government 
u/s 197 Cr.PC. which was declined and therefore, a closure report was 
filed in the competent court. However, the Court rejected the closure 
report on 20.12.1995 and took cognizance.  The State Government filed a 
Criminal Revision Application in the Sessions Court, which was rejected. 
A case u/s 302,323,506(1), 114 of IPC has now been committed to 
Sessions Court, Jamnagar and is presently pending with the Fast Track 
Court, Jam -khambhalia for framing of charges again st Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
and others. Significantly, Gujarat High Court awarded a compensation of 
Rs.1,50,000/ - to the victim who had died due to police atrocities in the 
above case.

Another criminal complaint was filed against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, 
while he was posted as SP, Banaskantha District in 1996 by Shri 
Sumersingh Rajpurohit, an Advoçate practicing at Pali, Rajasthan and a 
criminal case was registered aga inst Shri Sanjiv Bhatt & others vide FIR 
No.403/96 dated 18 -11-1996 u/s 120B, 195, 196,342, 347,357,365, 
388,458,482 IPC and Sec. 58 (1) & 58 (2) of NDPS Act. On completion of 
343  
 
the investigation, a chargesheet was filed against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt & 
others u/ s 114, 120B, 323, 342, 348, 357, 365,368, 388, 452, 201 & 482 
IPC and Sec. 9, 17, 18, 29, 58(1): & 58 (2) r/w Sec. 37 of NDPS Act in the 
court of Spl. Judge, NDPS Act, Jodhpur, Rajasthan. The allegations in 
brief are that the complainant Shri Surnersingh R ajpurohit, Advocate was 
occupying a property as a tenant in Pali (Rajasthan), which was owned by 
a lady, who happened to be a sister of Shri R.R. Jain, a sitting Judge of 
Gujarat High Court. As per the said criminal complaint Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
and his subo rdinate police officers planted 1½ kg of Narcotic drug in one 
room in a hotel at Palanpur, Gujarat, which was shown as occupied by 
the said complainant though he was at Pali (Rajasthan) at that time. The 
said Advocate was abducted at midnight, on the instr uctions of Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt by his subordinate police officers of Gujarat police, who went 
from Palanpur, Gujarat to Pali (Rajasthan) to abduct him. The said 
Advocate was brought to Palanpur, Gujarat and pressurized by Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt and his subordinat e police officers to vacate the said 
property by showing him arrested under NDPS offence. The said Advocate, 
while in the custody of Gujarat Police and due to police torture, vacated 
the property and physical possession of the property was handed over to 
the sister of Shri R.R. Jain, Judge of Gujarat High Court. Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt and his subordinate police officers thereafter released Shri 
Surnersingh Rajpurohit on 08 -05-1996, by filing a report u/s 169 Cr.PC. 
in which it was mentioned that Shri Sumersingh could not be identified 
in the Test Identification Parade. Quashing Petitions were filed in this 
matter by the accused persons in Rajasthan and Gujarat High Courts, 
but the same had been dismissed. The matter is now pending before the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court  of India.  
In the meantime, on the complaint of Shri Sidheshwar Puri, 
Secretary, Bar Association, Pali (Rajasthan), National Human Rights 
Commission, taking a very serious view of this false case under NDPS 
Act, vide its order dated 15 -09-2010 asked Govt. of Gujarat to pay a 
sum of Rs. one lakh as monetary relief to Shri Sumersingh, Advocate 
Pali.  
Significantly, Gujarat Vigilance Commission recommended twice on 
15-07-2002 and 19 -10-2006 that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt should be placed 
under suspension for his professional misconducts, but the Govt. of 
Gujarat did not do so.  
In view of the aforesaid position, it can be inferred that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt is facing a lot of problems in service matters and has 344  
 
got an axe to grind against the Govt. of Gujarat and, ther efore, his 
evidence is ill motivated and can not be relied upon.  
Government of Gujarat vide its letter dated 22 -06-2011 
forwarded a set of emails exchanged between Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, DIG, 
Gujarat Police and certain individuals during April & May 2011. It 
was mentioned in the above letter that during the course of an 
inquiry instituted against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, IPS by DG (Civil 
Defence), Gujarat regarding misuse of official resources, some 
revelations have been made having direct bearing on the cases being 
monitored by SIT. The material forwarded by Govt. of Gujarat has 
been scrutinised and the salient features of the same are summarized 
as below: - 
(1) That top Congress Leaders of Gujarat namely Shri Shaktisinh 
Gohil, Leader of Opposition in Gujarat Legislative Assembly and 
Shri Arjun Modhvadia, President of Gujarat Pradesh Congress 
are in constant touch with Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, DIG.  They are 
providing him "Packages", certain materials and also legal 
assistance Further, on 28 -04-2011, Shri Sanjiv Bhat t 
exchanged mails with Shri Shaktisinh Gohil and the former 
gave points for arguments in Hon'ble Supreme Court matter, 
allegations to be made against the members of SIT and to 
establish that the burning of a coach of Sabarmati Express at 
Godhra Railway Sta tion was not a conspiracy. From the emails, 
it appears that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was holding personal meetings 
with senior congress leaders as well. In one of the emails, he 
even mentions that he was "under exploited" by the lawyer 
representing Congress befor e Nanavati Commission of Inquiry.  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 416 
 
(2) That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had been persuading various NGOs and 
other interested groups to influence the Ld. Amicus Cur iae and 
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India by using "Media Card" and 
"Pressure Groups".  
(3)  Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had been exchanging emails with one Nasir 
Chippa and in the email dated 11 -05-2011 Shri Bhatt has stated 
that he (Nasir Chippa), should try to mobilize support/pressure -
345  
 
groups in Delhi to influence Ld. Amicus Curiae Shri Raju 
Ramchandran in a very subtle manner. In another email dated 
18-05-2011, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had requested Shri Nasir Chippa 
to influence Home Minister Shri P. Chidambaram thro ugh 
pressure groups in U.S. It is believed that Shri Nasir Chippa has 
strong U.S. connections and his family stays there.  
(4) That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt arranged an appeal from Shri M. Hasan 
Jowher, who runs a so called NGO titled SPRAT (Society for 
Promoting Rationality) to Amicus Curi ae on 13 -05-2011, to call 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, IPS, Shri Rajnish Rai, IPS, Shri Satish Verma, 
IPS, Shri Kuldeep Sharma, IPS and Shri Rahul Sharma, IPS (all 
police officers of Gujarat) to tender their version of the Gujarat 
story. I t may be mentioned here that the draft for the said 
appeal was sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt himself to Shri Jowher. 
Further, a copy of this mail was circulated by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
to Ms. Shabnam Hasmi, Ms. Teesta Setalwad, Shri Himanshu 
Thakker, journalist, Shri Leo Saldana, Journalist, and Shri Nasir 
Chippa to encourage the persons/organisation to write to 
Amicus Curi ae on the similar lines so as to pressurize him . 
(5) In emails exchanged on June 1, 2011 between Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
and Shri M.H. Jowher, it was  proposed that a PIL may be filed 
through a lawyer named Shri K. Vakharia (a Sr. Advocate and 
Chairman of Legal Cell of Congress Party in Gujarat)  in the 
Gujarat High Court for providing security to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt. 
It was also proposed that another comp laint may be filed with 
the Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City against Shri 
Narendra Modi & others for his alleged involvement in 2002 
riots which would be taken to appropriate judicial forums in due 
course.  
(6) That Ms. Teesta Setalwad, her lawyer Shr i Mihir Desai and 
Journalist Shri Manoj Mitta of Times of India were in constant 
touch with Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, IPS and were instrumental in 
arranging/drafting of the affidavit for filing the same in Hon’ble 
Supreme Court. Vide email dated 10 -04-2011, Shri Bhatt 
solicited "Co -ordinates" from Ms. Teesta Setalwad, who had also 
arranged for a meeting with her lawyer Shri Mihir Desai at 
Ellisbridge Gymkhana, Ahmedabad.  Shri Sanjiv Bhatt sent the 
first draft of his proposed affidavit to Shri Manoj Mitta on 13 -
04-2011, after meeting Shri Mihir Desai, Advocate and invited 
his suggestions. Shri Manoj Mitla advised Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to 346  
 
incorporate a few more paragraphs drafted by him which were 
incorporated by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt in his final affidavit sent to 
Hon’ble Supreme Court of India as suggested by Shri Mitta . 
(7) That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was instrumental in arranging an 
affidavit of one Shri Shubhranshu Chaudhary, a journalist, to 
corroborate his claim that he had gone to attend a meeting 
called by the Chief Mini ster at his residence in the night of 27 -
02-2002. Significantly, Shri Bhatt had sent his mobile phone 
details of 27 -02-2002 to Shri Shubhranshu Chaudhary and had 
also suggested the probable timings of his meeting to Shri 
Shubhranshu Chaudhary on 15 -05-2011 . Simultaneously, these 
details were sent to Ms. Teesta Setalwad on 26 -05-2011, for 
drafting the document, presumably the affidavit to be filed by 
Shri Shubhranshu Chaudhary. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt sent an email 
to Shri Shubhranshu Chaudhary that the said affid avit could be 
leaked out to the print media which would force the Amicus 
Curiae and Hon’ble Supreme Court to take notice of the same. 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt also sent another email to Shri Shubhranshu 
Chaudhary, in which he has stated that they should play the 
“Media Trick” so that affidavit is taken seriously by Amicus 
Curie and the Hon'ble Supreme Court  
(8) That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had been exchanging emails with one 
Leo Saldana, a Narmada Bachao Andolan activist, with a view to 
mobilize public opinion in their favour. On 01 -05-2011, Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt had sent an email to the latter to the effect that 
what they needed to do at this stage was to create a situation, 
where it would be difficult for three judges Supreme Court 
Bench to disregard the shortcomings of SI T under stewardship 
of  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 417 
 
Mr. ‘Raghavan’ and that the Pressure groups and opinion 
makers in Delhi could be of great help in forwarding the cause. 
He has further stated in the mail that he was hopeful that 
things would start turning around from the next hearing, if 
proper pressure was maintained at National level.  
347  
 
(9) That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was trying to contact Shri K.S. 
Subramanyam, a retired IPS officer, through Shri Nasir Chippa 
to make an affidavit supporting his stand with a view to 
convince the Amicus Curiae arid through him the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court of India that Shri K Chakravarthi former DGP of 
Gujarat, was a liar.  
(10)  That Shri Sanjiv Bha tt had been taking advice of Ms. Teesta 
Setalwad in connection with his evidence before Nanavati 
Commission of Inquiry. He had also been in touch with various 
journalists, NGOs and had been forwarding his representations, 
applications and other documents t hrough email; whereas on 
the other side he had been claiming privilege that being an 
Intelligence Officer he was duty bound not to disclose anything 
unless, he was legally compelled to do so.  
(11)  That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had been maintaining a close contact  
with Shri Rahul Sharma, DIG of Gujarat Police and had been 
getting his mobile phone calls analysed with a view to ascertain 
his own movements of 27 -02-2002. This shows that Bhatt does 
not recollect his movements on that day. He has also been 
trying to asc ertain the movements of Late Haren Pandya, the 
then Minister of State for Revenue on 27 -02-2002, with a view 
to introduce him as a participant of the meeting of 27 -02-2002 
held at CMs residence, but could not do so, as Shri Rahul 
Sharma had informed him af ter the analysis that there was 
absolutely no question of Late Haren Pandya being at 
Gandhinagar on 27 -02-2002 night.  
From the study of emails, it appears that certain vested 
interests including Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, different NGOs and some 
political leaders were trying to use Hon'ble Supreme Court/SIT as a 
forum for settling their scores. This would also go to show that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt had been colluding with the persons with vested 
interests to see that some kind of charge -sheet is filed against Shri 
Naren dra Modi and others.  
 
Observations made by Ld. Amicus Curiae : 
“The other circumstances would also have to be taken into account. 
There is nothing to show that CM intervened on 28 -02-2002, when 
the riots were taking place to prevent the riots. The movement of 
Shri Modi and the instructions given by him on 28 -02-2002, would 348  
 
have been decisive to prove that he had taken all steps for the 
protection of the minorities, but this evidence is not there. Neither 
CM nor his personal officials have stated what he did on 28 -02-
2002. Neither the top police nor bureaucrats have spoken about any 
decisive action by CM”.  
This one of the circumstances which indicates that the Hon'ble 
Chief Minister had not taken enough steps to ensure that riots in 
Ahmedabad City were immediately controlled by his direct 
intervention.  
Result of further investigation : 
During further investigation Shri Sanjay Bhavsar, OSD to CM has 
stated that on 28 -02-2002, the Chief Minister held a meeting in the 
morning concerning business in the Assem bly. Further, at 0830 hrs the 
Chief Minister attended the Assembly session, in which there was an 
obituary reference for those killed in Godhra incident. In the Assembly, 
the Chief Minister announced the Judicial Inquiry into the incident under 
the Commiss ion of Inquiries Act instead of a High Level Inquiry 
announced earlier on 27 -02-2002, and the house was adjourned. The 
Chief Minister held a meeting in the Assembly Secretariat with the acting 
Chief Secretary, ACS (Home), DGP and Addl. DG (Int.) about the prevailing 
situation in the State. In this meeting, the matter relating to the 
calling of Army was also discussed, but no decision was taken and it 
was decided to watch the situation . Shri Ashok Narayan has 
categorically stated that Late Ashok Bhatt, the t hen Health Minister 
and Shri I.K. Jadeja, the then Minister did not attend the said 
meeting.  Though, Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP has stated that 
ACS (Home) had conveyed to him about the Government's instructions to 
the effect that the aforesaid two Ministers would  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 418 
 
sit in the two Control Rooms at Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad City to 
assist the police, yet Shri Ashok Narayan has stated that he does not 
recollect any such instructions.  
Shri Ashok Narayan has further stated that the Army had 
already been alerted on 27 -02-2002, but inquiry conducted with the 
local Army authorities had revealed that no force was available in 
349  
 
Gujarat and that the same had been deployed at the Borders. On 28 -
02-2002, another law & order review meeting was called by the Chief 
Minister at his residence around 1300 hrs or so, in which the 
situation was discussed and deployment of forces was reviewed. In 
this meeting, it was unanimously decided that Army should be  called 
to assist the civil administration to maintain law & order as the 
situation in the State was getting out of control. In view of this, the 
Chief Minister made an oral request to Shri L.K. Advani, the then 
Union Home Minister over phone for deploymen t of Army in the 
State. As decided in the meeting, a fax message was sent by Shri K. 
Nityanandam, the then Secretary (Home) to the Secretary, Ministry 
of Defence, Govt. of India at 1430 hrs seeking deployment of 10 
columns of Army at Ahmedabad City and oth er affected places 
immediately by airlifting them. The Chief Minister had earlier given 
instructions for the safe escort of the Hajj Pilgrims returning to the 
State to avoid any untoward incident. The fax message in this regard 
was sent on 27 -02-2002, to A ddl. DG (Int.) with information to the 
DGP by the Section Officer (Spl.), Home Department, Govt. of 
Gujarat.   
The chief Minister along with his cabinet colleagues and 
officials of the Home Department reached Circuit House Annexe, 
Shahibaug, Ahmedabad City  around 1600 hrs or so and held a 
meeting with the officers of the Home Department. Subsequently. 
the Chief Minister held a press conference at Circuit House Annexe, 
Shahibaug, Ahmedabad City between 1630 hrs and 1745 hrs. In this 
press conference, CM anno unced that a decision had been taken by 
the State Govt. to call the Army. A video CD of the press conference 
has been produced by Shri Sanjay Bhavsar. At about 1800 hrs, the 
Chief Minister's appeal to public for keeping peace and to maintain 
law & order wa s recorded by the Dood -Darshan at Circuit House 
Annexe, Shahibaug, Ahmedabad City and the same was televised at 
1855 hrs before the regional news bulletin. The Chief Minister held 
another law & order meeting at his residence at 2030 hrs 28 -02-2002, 
which w as attended by the senior officers of the Home Department 
and the police. The Chief Minister met the Union Defence Minister 
Shri George Fernandes at his residence at 2230 hours on 28.02.2002, 
in the presence of concerned officers, in which the prevalent la w and 
order situation was reviewed and security arrangements discussed. 
This is confirmed from the records of the Protocol Department as 
well as the Police Control Room messages.  350  
 
According to Shri Sanjay Bhavsar, OSD to CM, the Chief 
Minister met Shri Geor ge Fernandes, the then Union Defence 
Minister on 01 -03-2002 at about 0830 hrs at his residence in the 
presence of Govt. Officials and Army Officers. As per the press release 
issued by the Gujarat Information Bureau on 01 -03-2002, Shri 
Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home), Shri G. Subba Rao, the then

senior police officers including Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP, 
Shri K. Nityanandam, the then Secretary (Home) and senior Army

CPMFs in the Stare. CM also informed the press about the 
requisitioning of the additional security forces from the

As per the request made by the Govt. of Gujarat, the Army 
personnel were airlifted from the border and they started arriving at 
Ahmedabad City in the night intervening 28 -02-2002/01 -03-2002. 
Shri P.S Sha h, the then Addl. Secretary (L&O) has stated that on 
receipt of intimation from the Army authorities, a programme 
indicating the arrival of the Army and their logistic requirements was 
sent to the CsP and DMs, Ahmedabad City, Baroda City and Rajkot

Shri P.S. Shah has further stated that on 01 -03-2002, another 
crash wireless message was sent by Shri J.R. Rajput, the then Under 
Secretary , Home Department with the approval of the ACS (Home) to 
all CsP, DMs, SsP, IGs and Western Railway SP, Baroda, in which it

implementation of communal riots scheme, guidelines given by the 
Govt. of India to promote communal harmony, effective actions 
352

Shri P.S. Shah, the then Addl. Secretary (L&O) has also stated 
that on 01 -03-2002, DGP felt that the resources available with him 
were insufficient to deal with the law & order situation in the Gujarat

Shri K. Nityanandam, the then Secretary (Home) to Chief Secretary, 
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharasthra, through which these 
states were requested to spare 10 companies each of their Armed

situation. A reply dated 01 -03-2002 was received from Shri R.K. Nair,

discussions with the Chief Secretary regarding the need to activate 
the intelligence machinery in the prevailing situation. It was further

even more nece ssary to take concrete steps in order to prevent 
worsening of the situation. Shri Ashok Narayan had suggested to DCP 
to constitute a task force involving Shri R.C. Mehta, Shri R.B. 
Sreekumar and Shri G.C. Raiger to work out a suitable plan within 
about 3 d ays.  
Shri P.S. Shah, the then Addl. Secretary (L&O) has further

03-2002, 28 -03-2002 and 29 -03-2002 respectively by different 
communities of the society. In the light of highly surcharged and 
tense atmosphere prevailing in the State, it was f urther emphasised 
upon the jurisdictional officers that HSC/SSC examination were also 
being held in all over the state (except 5 cities) and therefore, special 
attention should be paid to the sensitive areas and places, which had 
recently witnesses communa l violence. All the jurisdictional officers

Mohharram i.e. Qattal ki rat  and during Tazia processions. 
Instructions were also given to all the aforesaid officers to remain 
present at their headqua rters and closely supervise all the 363  
 
arrangements for maintenance of public order and communal 
harmony under their jurisdiction.  
Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home), Shri P.S. Shah, the 
then Addl . Secretary (L&O) and Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP 
have stated that in addition to the aforesaid references, a number of

was taken by them over telephone, for which no records are available. 
According t o them, after 72 hours, the situation was gradually  
coming under control though even subsequently stray incidents of 
violence were reported from different parts of the State for a few 
days. However, the Panchayat elections were held in March -April, 
2002 peacefully, and the Haj -Pilgrims who had returned fro m 
pilgrimage were safely escorted to their respective places without 
any untoward incident. The fact that the festivals like Maha -
Shivratri, Holi, Good Friday and the religious function of Mohharram, 
as well as SSCI -/HSC examination passed off peacefully i n March, 
2002 would go to show that the State was returning to normalcy fast.  
Keeping in view the aforesaid facts, it is established that the 
Godhra train burning incident took place on 27 -02-2002 between 
07.47 and 08.20 hrs. There is evidence available  on record to show 
that immediately the State machinery, was put on the high alert and 
this was communicated to all District authorities and Commissioners 
of Police. The first alert message of 27 -02-2002 from the Home 
Department covered the need to take preca utionary measures 
including adequate police bandobast and preventive measures 
including issuance of prohibitory

orders depending upon the local situatio n. It was instructed that 
antisocial and hardcore communal elements should be dealt with 
family. It was also impressed upon the district administration that 
when the dead bodies arrive in the respective native places, there 
was a likelihood of heightened c ommunal tension and hence 
bandobast should be arranged, especially for the funeral procession. 
All Commissioners of Police DMs and SsP should remain in HQ and 
closely monitor the situation.  
364  
 
This alert message of 27 -02-2002 was followed by another 
message f rom Home Department on 28 -02-2002, to all concerned to

provided at pla ces of worship and that effective action should be 
taken to disperse unruly mob, unlawful assemblies, using whatever 
force necessary. It was also made clear that anti -social elements 
indulging in violence and bent upon jeopardizing communal harmony 
must be  controlled firmly. Another message dated 28 -02-2002, 
impressed upon all concerned officers to maintain adequate 
bandobast for 01 -03-2002, being Friday and the day of Namaz for the 
Muslims. Adequate bandobast was directed to be provided to all 
sensitive ar eas and curfew was ordered to be strictly enforced. On 
28-02-2002, another message was sent to the Addl. DG (Int.) to 
maintain adequate bandobast for the security of returning Haj 
Pilgrims at their point of entry. It appears that realising the 
seriousness of the situation, the Chief Minister took a decision on 
28-02-2002, to call the Army to assist the civil administration in 
maintenance of law & order in the State. Accordingly, the Chief 
Minister spoke to the Union Home Minister on 28 -02-2002 around 
1400 h rs and orally requested him to depute the Army to control the 
law & order situation. This was followed by a fax message sent by 
Shri K. Nityanandam, the then Secretary (Home) to the Secretary, 
Ministry of Defence, Govt of India on 28 -02-2002 at 1430 hrs. 
Unfortunately, the Army was not locally available as it had been 
deployed on the borders, as a result of which the Army had to be 
airlifted to Ahmedabad and could be effectively deployed from 01 -03-
2002 onwards only.  
It is established that on 28 -02-2002, ev ents in the aftermath of 
the gruesome Godhra episode of 27 -02-2002 unfolded and violent 
incidents were reported from many parts of the State. A high level 
review of the situation at the Chief Minister's level was made on 28 -
02-2002 afternoon. The meeting w as attended by the Chief Minister, 
MoS (Home), the DGP and Addl. DG (Int.). By 1430 hrs, the Chief 
Minister had made an oral request to the Union Home Minister for 
Army deployment. At about the same time, an official request was 
sent in writing by Shri K. Nityanandam, the then Secretary (Home) 
to the Secretary, Ministry of Defence to make the Army available for 
internal security duties. The Chief Minister publicly announced at 
1600 hrs. in a press conference the decision of the State Govt. to call 365  
 
the Army.  Efforts were also made to requisition available Army 
personnel in the cantonment area of Ahmedabad, but no force was 
available. It was understood that withdrawing the Army at such 
critical juncture when war like situation existed with the neighbour 
needed  a high level decision at the Centre. This decision to withdraw 
the Army and deploy in Gujarat has immediately taken at highest 
level in the Centre at the request of Gujarat Govt.  
Army personnel were airlifted from forward positions and they 
started arrivi ng by the midnight of 28 -02-2002. It may be mentioned 
here that 40 aircrafts were used to airlift Army personnel to 
Ahmedabad. The first plane, landed at Ahmedabad on 28 -02-2002 
mid night and the last one on 01 -03-2002 at 2300 hrs. The 
deployment of the Ar my also required additional logistic support by 
the civil administration in the form of Executive Magistrates, 
vehicles, Liaison officer, mobile phones, guides and maps and same 
were promptly made available to them. The deployment of Army 
commenced by 1100  hrs after a high level meeting with the Chief 
Minister and the Union Defence Minister along with senior officials 
of the Army and the state administration. The Army was deployed in 
the affected areas of Ahmedabad City i.e. Paldi, Juhapura, Vejalpur, 
Shahp ur, Bapunagar, Rakhial, Gomtipur, Meghaninagar; Dariapur, 
Kalupur, Naroda and Dani Limda. It may thus be se en that 9 columns 
of Army were deployed on 01 -03-2002. Later on, 2 columns of the 
Army were moved to Vadodara on 01 -03-2002 at 1830 hrs, 2 columns 
despatched to Godhra on 02 -03-2002, and they reached Godhra at 
0130 hrs, 2 columns moved to Rajkot on 02 -03-2002 at 1100 hrs. It 
may be mentioned here that while the situation in the other parts of 
the Gujarat was grave, cities like Bhavnagar and S urat were initially 
unaffected. However, as incidents of violence were reported from 
Bhavnagar and Surat, Army columns were moved to Surat on 03 -03-
2002 at 1100 hrs and to Bhavnagar on 03 -03-2002 at 2235 hrs. In all 
26 Army columns had been deployed at the  peak of riots in the State.

In addition, the Govt. of India had approved the deployment of 
CPMFs and therefore, 6 Coys of CISF, 11 Coys of BSF, 5 Coys o f 
Border Wing Home -guards and 4 Coys of RAF were deployed in the 
366  
 
State by 03 -03-2002. The State Govt. had also made a request on 28 -
02-2002, to the neighbouring States of Maharasthra, Rajasthan and 
Madhya Pradesh to spare the services of their Armed Reserv e Police 
companies. However, only Mahara shtra responded by sending 2 Coys 
of SRP, whereas the Govt. of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh 
expressed their inability to spare any police force due to the internal 
commitments. It may thus be seen that there was no d elay, 
whatsoever in requisitioning the Army and its deployment by the 
State as and when they realised. on 28 -02-2002 afternoon that the 
situation was going beyond control. Significantly, Union Defence 
Minister arrived at Ahmedabad on 28.02.2002 night to en sure that 
Army formations take their positions without any delay.  
Shri G. Subha Rao, the then Chief Secretary, who had gone 
aboard, was recalled and he arrived on 01 -03-2002. The Chief 
Secretary had issued a clear cut message to all the jurisdictional 
offi cers to take effective action including implementation of 
Communal Riot Scheme, to act in a decisive, prompt and effective 
manner to control the situation and not to hesitate to use whatever 
force was necessary to bring the situation under control, if any life 
and property were threatened. It was impressed by him that firing be 
resorted to as per situation and if the situation deteriorates beyond 
a point, besides imposing curfew even shoot at sight orders should 
be given to control the unruly mobs. This wir eless message from the 
Chief Secretary gives clear cut indication and mind of the State that 
the riots had to be controlled at any cost.  
Frantic messages were sent by the Home Department on 01 -03-
2002 to 06 -03-2002 and specific instructions were given to the effect 
that the riots had to be controlled and all steps should be taken to 
restore normalcy and peace in the State. In addition, 14 messages 
were sent by the Home Department, which included measures, to be 
taken for ensuing festivals, arrival  of Hajj pilgrims and their security, 
Jumma Namaz, Ram -Navami, Moharrum, Holi -Dhuleti and Good 
Friday. These messages also included the necessary precautions to 
be taken in the issues relating to symbolic or actual bhumi pooja 
proposed to be performed by t he Ramsevaks on 15 -03-2002, about 
which the specific orders had been issued by the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of India to maintain status -quo.  
Further investigation has also disclosed that the Chief 
Secretary and Addl. Chief Secretary (Home) had arranged for tw o 
video conferences with the CP, DMs, SP and other concerned officers 367  
 
on 04 -03-2002 and 11 -03-2002, in which important items on agenda 
were as follows: - 
i. Review of current law and order situation in the state  
ii. Effective deployment of various forces  
iii. Instruction  for holding Peace Committee meetings and Peace 
Marches  
iv. Curbing violence and protecting places of worship.  
v. Preventive measures and other actions against criminals 
including, detention  
vi. Incidents of 15 -03-2002 at Ayodhya and Ram -mandir issue  
vii. Bandobast for SSC/HSC examination  
viii.  Attention to various alert messages issued about law & order, 
ensuing festivals and Haj pilgrims  
It has also come to light during further investigation that from 
27-02-2002 onwards, high level meeting s with the Chief Minister and 
senior officers were held in the morning as well as in the evening. 
The Chief Secretary and the ACS (Home) also held atleast one 
meeting per day with DGP and other senior police officers, in which 
the current situation during the last 24 hours was reviewed including 
the bandobast and deployment of forces. The Chief Secretary also 
held separate high level meetings with Army officers on 07 -03-2002, 
18-03-2002 & 23 -03-2002 . 
Further investigation has established that the State Govt . was 
reasonably vigilant vis -à-vis the developments on the law & order 
front and immediately responded by bringing to the notice of all 
District officials, the need to maintain adequate bandobast in view 
of the Godhra incident on 27 -02-2002. In addition, written 
communications were sent on day to day basis with specific 
instructions to control the law & order situation with a view to bring 
normalcy, communal peace and harmony in the State at all costs. 
The State authorities also impressed upon jurisdiction al officers that 
violators of law should be effectively dealt with, no laxity shown and 
maximum force used to suppress and contain the violence. The 
allegation about the inaction on the part of State Govt. as well as 
police department is, therefore, not es tablished.

Observations made by Ld. Amicus Curiae : 
It is difficult to believe that when CM came back after the Godhra 
trip, no Minister was present at his residence, Hence, it may not be 
totally unbelievable that Shri Haren Pandya was present. Shri 
Haren Pandya is unfortunately dead, but the statements made by 
Late Shri Haren Pandya to Justice P.B. Sawant (Retd.) and Justice 
H. Suresh (Ret.) c an be used, even if his statement is not been 
formally reproduced in the writing by the Citizen's Tribunal.  
It has also been brought out that an enquiry was made from CM's 
office as to the identity of the Minister who had deposed before the 
Citizen's Tribu nal and that the State Intelligence Bureau had 
verified the identity as that of Shri Haren Pandya. This also gives 
some corroboration to the fact that CM's office was uncomfortable 
with the disclosure made by an unidentified Minister to the Citizen's 
Tribu nal.  
 
Result of further investigation : 
Further investigation revealed that the Chief Minister left 
Godhra at about 1945 hrs on 27 -02-2002 by road and reached 
Vadodara airport at about 2130 hrs. Shri Narendra Modi left for 
Ahmedabad by Govt aircraft around 2130 hrs. From Ahmedabad 
airport CM went to Gandhinagar by road and reached his official 
residence at about 2230 hrs. On his return, he called for a law & order 
meeting at about 2300 hrs, which was attended by the top officials 
of administration, Home and Police department. Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP said that on  27-02-2002, late in the 
evening while he was in Door -Darshan studio, Ahmedabad City, he 
received a message from State Police Control Room that CM had 
called for a meeting at his  residence a t Gandhinagar at about 2230 
hrs. He has further stated that he had reached at CM's residence 
alone a little earlier and waited there as CM had not arrived at that 
time. Subsequently, Smt. Swarna Kanta Varma, the then acting Chief 
Secretary Shri Ashok Naray an, the then ACS (Home), Shri P.C. Pande, 
the then CP, Ahmedabad City and Shri K. Nityanandam, the then 
Secretary (Home) also arrived there. According to Shri Chakravarthi, 
369  
 
the meeting was held around 2300 hrs or could be a little earlier and 
lasted for ab out 20 -30 minutes. All the participants of the said 
meeting have categorically stated that none of the 
Minister/politician attended the said meeting. Mr. Justice 
P.B.Sawant, Retired Judge of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and Mr. 
Justice Hosbet Suresh, Ret ired Judge of Bombay High Court, 
members of the Concerned Citizens Tribunal - Gujarat 2002, (that 
was conceived in response to the Godhra carnage on 27 -02-2002) 
have stated that one Minister of the Gujarat Govt. namely Late Haren 
Pandya, appeared and depos ed before the Tribunal on 13 -05-2002, on 
condition of anonymity, that he had attended a meeting on 27 -02-
2002 night at the residence of Shri Narendra Modi, CM, in which the 
latter had made it clear that there would be a backlash from the 
Hindus on the next  day and that the police should not come in their 
way. According to Justice Sawant, Late Haren Pandya revealed that 
Shri Modi also instructed the police officers and Civil servants that 
a Hindu reaction was expected and the same must not be curtailed 
or co ntrolled. However, his deposition had not been recorded 
anywhere by the Tribunal.  
Further investigation revealed that an inquiry into the Godhra 
incident as well the riots that followed the Godhra carnage was conducted 
by Concerned Citizen Tribunal sometime in April -May, 2002 and their 
report was published on 21 -11-2002, in the form of a book titled “Crime 
Against Humanity”, which bears the signatures of Mr. Justice P.B. 
Sawant, Retd. and Mr. Justice Hosbet Suresh, Retd. beside others. The 
extracts f rom page 249 of volume -l of “Crime Against Humanity” are 
reproduced below :- 
“Witnesses deposing before us testified to the fact that the 
chief minister called a meeting of senior police and other 
officers on that very night of February 27, 2002. At this 
meeting specific instructions were given by him in the 
presence of state home minister on how the police should 
deal with the situation on the bandh day. We were informed 
that instruction were given in this meeting by the Chief 
minister specifically not to t ake action against any Hindu 
reaction to Godhra”.  
This report would go to show that, the State Home Minister i.e. Shri 
Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home) was present in the said meeting, 
whereas there is conclusive evidence to establish that Shri Gordhan 
Zadafia, had stayed at Godhra on 27 -02-2002 and returned on 28  370

-02-2002 morning. Nowhere, the name of Late Haren Pandya, who was 
holding the port folio of Minister of State for Revenue had been mentioned 
in the said report. On the contrary, Late Haren Pandya had been severely 
criticized by the Concerned Citizen Tribunal in its report. Some of the 
extracts from the said report are reproduced below: - 
“Naroda Patiya and Naroda Gaon have a long history of VHP 
provocation. Police sources revealed to expert witnesses who 
deposed before the Tribunal, that in 1999 a dargah was 
broken down and an idol installed in its place. At the time, 
the local police repa ired the dargah and arrested 10 -15 
persons, including Dr. Jaideep Patel, Maya Kodnani and 
Amrish Pandey. Pressure was mounted on the police by the 
then home minister, Haren Pandya, but the police stood their 
ground and the law -breakers were forced to back down” 
(page -36. of Vol.1)  
“On the night of February 27 -28, the elephants that are kept 
inside the temple premises were made to drink liquor.  The 
sounds and trumpeting that followed caused terror in the 
entire locality. During the last election, former min ister 
Haren Pandya, who won from the Paldi area, had openly 
proclaimed during his campaign, Baandyo nahin bachwo 
joyiye. (Not a single baandyo, abusive term for a 
Muslim/circumcised person must be spared..)” (page -44 of 
Vol.1)  
“Three eyewitnesses, who depo sed before the Tribunal, saw 
former revenue -minister Haren Pandya opposite the VS 
Hospital, setting fire to the Apna Bazaar Medical. Aa Miyaone 
aag lagadiye. (Let us burn these Muslims.), he was shouting 
after he had burnt it down himself. The Ellis Bridge  police 
station is close by but they did nothing. The fire brigade was 
called and they tried desperately to put out the fire. But 
Pandya, leading the mob, prevented them. An FIR has been 
launched against him and BJP MLA Ashok Bhatt. Just 
outside the Ellis Bridge police station, Haren Pandya was 
overheard telling the PI, even as Hotel Ellis was aflame, Aah 
371  
 
samaj kayi nathi kartoo. (This community does nothing.) The 
PI concerned had a special room permanently booked for him 
at Hotel Ellis”. (page -44 of Vol.1)  
“There were attacks on 6 housing societies in Paldi, where 
about 1,000 Muslims live. In all, there are about 5 -6,000 
Hindus living in this area. Kazmi Apartments, Elite, Delite, 
Corner 2, Tarana Apartments and Bungalows No. 16 and 24 
in Paldi, occupied by  the owners of Motimahal, were 
completely burnt. Eyewitesses testified to seeing the then 
Gujarat revenue minister, Haren Pandya, leading mobs who 
then committed arson”. (page -48 of Vol. 1)  
“Detailed evidence was recorded by us regarding the 
desecration of  the tomb of Wali Gujarati, a renowned poet 
remembered as the founder of Urdu poetry. On March 1. His 
tomb, located not more than 10 metres from the office of 
Ahmedabad's commissioner of police (also the police 
headquarters) was demolished and a saffron fl ag hoisted on 
the site. It is believed that the shrine was torn down by 
marauding mobs under the directions of Gujarat's revenue 
minister, Shri Haren Pandya. This flag was removed on the 
night of March 2. On March 8, a tarred road was constructed 
at the si te, leaving no trace whatsoever of the tomb that had 
stood there for nearly three centuries. It is shocking that a 
calious government and an unprincipled administration 
participated in the utter obliteration of this cultural 
monument and allowed a road to be constructed over it”. 
(page - 48 of Vol. 2)  
“On the night of March 3, a 400 -year -old mosque owned by 
the Wakf Board, and located near Anjali Cinema in 
Ahmedabad, was broken down in the presence of state 
ministers Shri Haren Pandya and Shri Amit Shah. As  in many 
other cases, a Hulladiya Hanuman idol was installed there, 
followed by darshans and artis”. (page -49 of Vol.2)  
"The Tribunal observes that in Gujarat, many cabinet 
ministers are simultaneously prominent leaders of the VHP. 
The home minister, Shri Gordhan Zadaphiya, is one of them. 
So, too, is the former revenue minister Shri Haren Pandya, a 
senior VHP functionary. He has been named by many 
witnesses who appeared before us, as trying to influence 
police not to take action against the accused. Minist er for 372  
 
forests, Shri Prabhat Singh Chauhan and minister for cottage 
Industres, Shri Narayan Laloo Patel are also two clear 
examples of this”. (page -52 of Vol.2)  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Pag e: 429 
 
“Some of the senior BJP leaders and ministers in Shri Modi's 
cabinet were also alleged to have participated in the 
destruction of minority places of worship. Minister for 
revenue, Shri Haren Pandya and health minister, Shri Ashok 
Bhatt led the mobs  enthusiastically in Ahmedabad. Shri 
Bharat Barot, a sitting MLA, was also at the forefront. 
Residents of Paldi, from where Shri Pandya was elected, 
actually saw him lead arson attacks. Shri Pandya ’s election 
promise the last time was to wipe any trace of Muslims out of 
Paldi”. (page -77 of Vo1.2)  
“One of the most shocking aspects of the Gujarat carnage was 
that the constituencies of some minister and sitting MLAs 
were the arena for the worst incidents of carnage. Bapunagar 
in Ahmedabad, one of the worst aff ected areas, is the home 
constituency of the minister of state for home, Shri Gordhan 
Zadaphiya. Paldi, Ahmedabad is the constituency of Shri 
Haren Pandya, former state home minister and, until 
recently, revenue minister in Shri Modi ’s cabinet”. (page -87 
of Vol .2)  
As regards the deposition of Late Haren Panda before the 
Concerned Citizens Tribunal, further investigation has established 
that the meeting convened at CMs residence, was an essentially law 
and order review meeting that was held on 27 -02-2002 an d that none 
of the Cabinet Ministers attended the same. Late Haren Pandya was 
not even a Cabinet Minister at that time and was holding the 
portfolio of Minister of State for Revenue. Shri Gordhan Zadafia, the 
then MoS for Home also did not attend this meet ing, as he had stayed 
back at Godhra. In view of the version of all the senior officials of the 
Home and Police Department the testimony of Late Haren Pandya 
before the Tribuna l becomes questionable . 
373  
 
As regards the entries made by Shri R.B. Sreekumar at page -21 on 
12-06-2002, in a register unauthorisedly maintained by him that the call 
details of the mobile phone of Late Haren Pandya were handed over to 
Shri P.K. Mishra, the then Principal Secretary to  CM through Shri O.P. 
Mathur in his office, the same appears to be doubtful as Shri Mathur has 
denied to have handed over any such call details to Dr. P.K. Mishra in his 
office and that Principal Secretary to CM never visited the office of the 
State IB, as  stated in the said entry made in the register. Moreover, Shri 
S.M. Pathak, the then Dy.SP, State IB has confirmed to have conducted 
secret inquiry about one of the Ministers, which had met a Forum of 
which Justice Krishna lyer, a retired Judge of Supreme Court and some 
others were the members, who had come to Ahmedabad to enquire into 
the riots in the state. Shri Pathak has also confirmed to have conducted 
secret inquiries, which revealed that Late Haren Pandya had met and 
deposed before them and that this  fact was reported to Shri R.B. 
Sreekumar orally. However, Shri Pathak has stated that he does not 
recollect, as to whether he was asked to collect the mobile phone details 
of Late Haren Pandya or not, which again creates a doubt about the entry 
made by Sh ri R.B. Sreekumar in his register. Shri PK. Mishra, the then 
Principal secretary to CM has stated that he does not recollect, as to 
whether be asked Shri R.B. Sreekumar to collect the mobile call records 
of Late Haren Pandya and that no phone call details were made available  
to him by either Shri Sreekumar or Shri O.P. Mathur. No disclosure was 
made by Shri R.B. Sreekumar about the said register in his deposition 
before the Commission on 31 -08-2004 or in any of the two affidavits filed 
by him on 15 -07-2002 & 06 -10-2004. It is  rather surprising that this 
register saw the light of the day for the first time in the year 2005, 
when Shri R.B. Sreekumar filed a copy of the same along with his 
third affidavit filed before the Nanavati -Shah Commission of Inquiry 
on 09 -04-2005. It may be mentioned here that this affidavit was filed 
by Shri R.B. Sreekumar after his super -session in promotion in 
February, 2005. In view of the fact that the register maintained by 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar can not be considered to be an authenticated 
document, th e entries made by him in his said register can not be 
considered to be reliable .  
Further investigation revealed that Govt. mobile no. 
9825039852 was allotted to Late Haren Pandya. The call detail 
records of the said mobile phone for 27 -02-2002 have been s orted 
out from CD made available by Shri Rahul Sharma, DIG and the same 
show that Late Haren Pandya remained at Ahmedabad City till 
10:46:55 on 27 -02-2002. His location at Ahmedabad City again 374  
 
comes at 16:24:24 hrs and thereafter he remained at Ahmedabad 
City till 22:52:07 hrs on 27 -02-2002 and therefore, this would 
conclusively establish that Late Haren Pandya did not attend the law 
& order review meeting that took place at CM's residence at 
Gandhinagar on 27.02 -2002 night.  
 
------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 430 
 
In view of the aforesaid position, it appears that Late Haren 
Pandya had misled the Hon'ble Members of Concerned Citizen Forum 
namely, Mr. Justice (Retd.) P.B. Sawant and Mr. Justice (R etd.) 
Hosbet Suresh that he was present in the meeting called by the Chief 
Minister at his residence on the night of 27 -02-2002 with a view to 
increase his credibility. It has been established beyond doubt that 
Late Haren Pandya could not have been present  in the said meeting 
and that the so called evidence given by him was only on hearsay 
basis. Since the statement made by Late Haren Pandya is on hearsay 
basis, it is not admissible under any provisions of law.  
 
Observation made by Ld. Amicus Curiae : 
The statement of Shri RB. Sreekumar cannot be discarded as 
hearsay, in the light of Section 6 of the Evidence Act . 
 
Result of further investigation : 
As far as allegation, which suggests that a statement was made 
by the Chief Minister Shri Narendra Modi on 27.0 2.2002, in a 
meeting at his residence instructing the senior officers to allow the 
Hindus to give vent to their anger is concerned, it is significant that 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar came on to the scene much afterwards and 
evidence brought by him is all hearsay. Shri R.B. Sreekumar became 
Addl. (Int.) only on 09.04.2002 and had not attended the meeting 
which was held much prior to his joining Ld. Amicus Curiae is of the 
view that the above statement of Shri R.B. Sreekumar cannot be 
discarded as hearsay in the ligh t of Section 6 of the Evidence Act. 
However, the facts suggest otherwise. If there is an interval between 
the acts of occurrence and the statement made by the person 
375  
 
concerned, it blocks the statements so made from acquiring 
legitimacy u/s 6 of the Indian Evidence Act . 
Keeping in mind the principles of law laid down by the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court of India in regards to hearsay evidence, it has been found 
that the evidence given by Shri R.B. Sreekumar neither forms part of the 
same transaction nor the said sta tements have been made by Shri 
Sreekumar at the time of occurrence of the incident or at least 
immediately thereafter and, therefore are not relevant as per Sec 6 of the 
Indian Evidence Act. In the instant case, the so called evidence of Shri 
R.B. Sreekuma r, concerning the events before the riots was his own 
perception as he had no direct knowledge of the same . 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar has contended that no follow up action was 
taken on the reports sent by him on 24 -04-2002, 15 -06-2002, 20 -08-
2002 & 28 -08-2002 a bout anti -minority stance of the administration. A 
letter dated 24 -04-2002 addressed to ACS (Home) with a copy to DGP 
contained an analytical note on current communal scenario in 
Ahmedabad City, which is general in nature and no specific instance has 
been cited. In brief, it has been mentioned in this note that of late the 
minority community was found to be taking an increasingly belligerent 
postures as they felt themselves as a section of population left at a total 
mercy of radical communal elements of Baj rang Dal and VHP. It was 
further mentioned chat the Muslim communities being the major victims 
of the riots developed a major grudge against the Criminal Justice System, 
which they felt was highly biased. According to Shri Sreekumar certain 
VHP and Bajrang  Pal leaders had started extorting protection money from 
the businessmen from both the communities and were pressurising the 
merchants and general public not to employ the me mbers of the minority 
community. It was further reported that both Hindu and Musli m 
communities had been inciting violence by way of distribution of 
pamphlets.  
Shri Sreekumar appeared on the scene 40 days after the riots 
and whatever has been claimed by him has no direct bearing on the 
facts in issue . Shri Sreekumar had also reported th at the inability of 
Ahmedabad police to control the violence by the communal mob had 
eroded the image of police as a law enforcing agency of the society and 
the media attacks on the police had a demoralising impact on the police 
personnel. It was also poin ted out that the Inspectors in charge of the 
police stations had been ignoring the instructions given by the senior 
officers and complying with the direct verbal instructions from the 
political leaders of the ruling party, who ensured their placement and 376  
 
continuance in their choice postings. He had also suggested the remedial 
measures such as restoration of faith amongst the minorities in Criminal 
Justice system replacement of present incumbents from executive posts 
at the cutting edge level, the spiritual leaders of Hindus and Muslims 
should launch a state wide campaign to expose the politicised pseudo

NGOs to restore mutual trust between the Hindus and Muslims, 
improvement of security in the riot affected areas to facilitate the 
rehabilitation of riot victims and purposeful legal action against 
publication and distribution of pamphlets inflaming communal passions 
etc.  
According to Shri Ashok Narayan, the then ACS (Home), this letter 
contained general observations and concrete details were missing. Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, the then D GP has stated tha t most of the points and issues 
raised by Shri R.B. Sreekumar, had been effectively dealt with by him in 
March -April/2002. He is also of the view that the observations made by 
Shri Sreekumar were totally general in nature and no specific instance 
had been cited by him, which could have called for any immediate action 
on his part.  
Shri R.B. Sreekumar had sent a review report of law & order 
situation on 15 -06-2002, in which he had mentioned about an 
unprecedented degree of revengefulness of the majority commu nity 
resulting in massive and ghastly violence against Muslims in a period of 
five days since Godhra carnage and that the communal violence was still 
continuing, Shri Sreekumar strongly recommended for the 
implementation of remedial measures to contain com munal violence and 
neutralizing the fundamentalist element in both majority and minority 
communities as suggested in his analytical nore dated 24 -04-2002. This 
law & order assessment report was called for in view of Rath -Yatra, which 
was likely to be held sometime in July 2002. In this report, Shri 
Sreekumar had expressed the view that on various grounds mentioned by 
him, the Rath -Yatra should not be taken out in near future till an 
atmosphere of durable peace and goodwill between the majority and 
minority communities was established. Shri Ashok Narayan the then ACS 
377  
 
(Home) has stated that the administration did not agree with the views of 
Shri Sreekumar and the Rath -Yatra was taken on 12 -07-2002, under 
police bandobast and no untoward incident took place any where.  
Shri R.B. Sreekumar has further stated that he had sent another 
report on the then prevailing law & order situation vide his letter dated 
20-08-2002. According to Shri Sreekumar, even at the time this letter was 
sent, the communal tension continued and the communal gap between 
Hindus and Muslims had widened to an unprecedented degree. It was 
further mentioned that there was latent communal tension in most of the 
places where incidents were reported and that any minor issue involving 
members of minori ty and majority community would reignite communal 
passions resulting in clashes, as had been witnessed in Dhoraji (Rajkot 
District) on 17 -08-2002. It was further mentioned by Shri Sreekumar that 
large sections of the minorities being the major victims of t he recent riots 
were still to develop adequate faith in Administration, Police Department 
and Criminal Justice System. This letter was replied by Shri Ashok 
Narayan, the then ACS (Home) on 09 -09-2002, in which he had clearly 
informed Shri Sreekumar that hi s assessment of law & order situation 
was not in tune with the feedback received from other agencies. Shri 
Ashok Narayan further mentioned that some apprehension and a feeling 
of insecurity amongst the members of the minority community was 
understandable i n isolated pockets from where incidents were reported, 
but the same do not indicate the feelings of insecurity anymore. Shri 
Ashok Narayan has also mentioned that Dhoraji's incident was an 
isolated incident and that communal incidents had come down drastic ally 
during the last few months. Shri Ashok Narayan disagreed with the 
views of Shri Sreekumar on the ground that no broad based inputs 
were relied upon by him before arriving at a conclusion . 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar had sent another report regarding the 
emerg ing law & order vide his letter dated 28 -08-2002. In this letter, he 
had assessed that the social relations between the Hindus and Muslims 
remained highly strained including the traditional communal pockets as 
well as new areas where the riots had taken pl ace, due to various reasons. 
Shri Sreekumar had suggested that District Magistrates/Commissioners 
of Police/Superintendent of Police be suitably advised to ensure that the 
organizers of the public function/political campaign should avoid 
projecting communa l issues that might widen the rift between the two 
communities and also to abide by the conditions of the license/ 
permission granted to them. Shri K. Chakravarthi has stated that Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar had given same suggestions and most of it pertained to 
the Revenue Department  and other departments. As far as police 378  
 
department was concerned, he (Shri Chakravarthi) had given 
directions based on his suggestions . 
In view of the aforesaid position, it cannot be said that no 
action was taken by the Govt. on the assessment of situation made 
by Shri R.B. Sreekumar. Of course, there was difference of opinion 
between Shri R.B. Sreekumar and the Home Department on certain 
issues. However, the fact remains that Shri Sreekumar appeared on 
the scene 40 days after the rio ts and remained

posted as Addl. DG (In1.) for a little more that five months, and 
therefore, whatever has been claimed by him has no direct bearing 
the issue i.e. events of 27/28 -02-2002 or subsequently in March 
2002 . 
 
> Observation made by Ld. Amicus Curiae : 
Another aspect is the fact that VHP General Secretary Jaydeep Patel 
and Shri Modi were at Godhra on 27 -02-2002. The statement of 
Jaydeep  Patel that he did not meet Shri Narendra Modi at Godhra 
does not inspire confidence. This has to be examined as the 
Mamlatdar would not have handed over the dead bodies to a non -
government person i.e. Jaydeep Patel until and unless somebody 
very high told  him to do so . 
 
Result of further investigation :- 
Further investigation revealed that Shri Narendra Modi, Chief 
Minister arrived at Godhra by helicopter around 1645 hrs and was 
accompanied by Shri Anil Mukim, the then Secretary to CM. He as 
received at the  helipad by Smt. Jayanti Ravi and Shri Ashok Bhatt and 
he straightaway drove to the Godhra Railway Station. CM inspected 
the spot and talked to some of the persons gathered there. From 
Godhra Railway Station, he went to Civil Hospital and saw the 
persons i njured in the Sabarmati Express train burning incident. 
Since, curfew had been imposed in Godhra town, the Chief Minister 
379  
 
then proceeded to Collectorate and held a meeting with the Ministers 
present there, namely Shri Ashok Bhatt, the then Health Minister,  
Shri Gordhan Zadafia , the then MoS (Home), Shri Bhupendra 
Lakhawala, the then MoS (Civil Defence), Shri Prabhatsinh Chauhan, 
the then MoS for Aviation & Pilgrimage and Shri Bhupendrasinh 
Solanki, the then MP, Godhra, Collector & District Magistrate, Police 
Officers and Railway  Officers. The Chief Minister had also met the 
Press thereafter. Smt. Jayanti Ravi has stated to SIT that in the 
meeting held at Collectorate, a unanimous decision was taken that 
the dead bodies, which had been identified should be handed over to 
their rel atives at Godhra itself and those bodies whose legal heirs or 
guardians had not come, could be sent to Sola Civil Hospital, 
Ahmedabad, since these deceased passengers were heading towards 
Ahmedabad in Sabarmati Express. The decision to send the bodies to 
Sola Civil Hospital was taken in view of the fact that it was situated 
on the outskirts of Ahmedabad City and thus away from the crowded 
area for security reasons. It has further come to light that out of 58 
burnt and dead bodies, 4 bodies belonging to Daho d, Vadodara, 
Panchmahal and Anand Districts were handed over to their legal 
heirs/guardians after identification at Godhra itself. The remaining 
54 dead bodies were to be sent with police escort to Sola Civil 
Hospital, Ahmedabad and Shri Jaydeep Patel, who  was present at 
Collectorate, was to accompany these dead bodies to Ahmedabad . 
Further investigation revealed that Shri M.L. Nalvaya, the then 
Mamlatdar & Executive Magistrate prepared a letter addressed to Dr. 
Jaydeep Patel of VHP, in which he had mention ed that 54 dead bodies 
were being sent through five trucks as detailed below:  
Sr. No.  Truck No  No. of Dead 
Bodies carried  
1.  GJ-17-5055  12 
2.  GJ-17-T-7557  15 
3.  GJ-17-X-3225  03 
4.  GJ-16-T-9253  12 
5.  GJ-17-T-7327  
(TATA 608 
tempo)  12 
 
Shri Hasmukh T. Patel of VHP had acknowledged the receipt of 
dead bodies. It may be mentioned here that the handing over of the 380  
 
bead bodies to their legal heirs/guardians was the  duty of the railway 
police, which had registered a case in connection with t his incident.  
On his further examination Shri Nalvaya has stated that these 
dead bodies were handed over officially to Shri Jaydeep Patel and 
Shri Hasmukh T. Patel of VHP as per the instructions given by Smt. 
Jayanti S. Ravi, District Magistrate, Godhra an d Late B.M. Damor, 
ADM, Godhra. Shri M.L Nalvaya has filed an affidavit, before Nanavati 
Commission of Inquiry to this  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 433 
 
effect on 05 -09-2002. However, Smt. Jayanti Ravi has stated that no 
such instructions were given to Shri Nalvaya to hand over the dead 
bodies to Shri Jaydeep Patel or Shri Hasmukh T. Patel of VHP and 
that Shri Jaydeep Patel was merely to accompany the dead bodies to 
Ahmedabad . 
Shri Jaydeep Patel visited  Godhra on 27 -02-2002 and was present 
at the Collectorate. Further investigation revealed that as per the call 
detail records of mobile phone no. 9825023887 of Shri Jaydeep Patel, he 
reached Godhra on 27 -02-2002 around 1248 hrs an d remained there till 
2358 hrs. At Godhra, he had made/received calls to/from Shri Gordhan 
Zadafia at the latter's mobile phone no. 9825049145. All these calls had 
been made/received between 2003 hrs and 2113 hrs. It is, therefore, quite 
possible that Shri  Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home), might have 
instructed the police authorities to allow Shri Jaydeep Patel to accompany 
the dead bodies. The aforesaid call detail records establish that Shri 
Jaydeep Patel remained at Godhra till about 2358 hrs on 27 -02-2002.  
Shri Jaydeep Patel has stated that he did not meet Shri Narendra 
Modi, Chief Minister. Since most of the persons, who had died in Godhra 
carnage were the karsevaks of Vishwa Hindu Parishad , he met some local 
administrative and police officials, who se names he could not recollect at 
this stage, and requested them to hand over the dead bodies of the 
Karsevaks to him for onward transportation to Ahmedabad. The district 
officials accede to his request and accordingly a letter was prepared by 
Mamlatdar a nd Executive Magistrate, Godhra in his name specifying the 
details of the dead -bodies and the number of trucks in the same. Shri 
Hasmukh T. Patel of VHP, who had accompanied him, acknowledge the 
381  
 
receipt of these dead -bodies as per his signature appering on  the list. It 
may be mentioned here that 58 persons had dies in this incident out of 
which 4 persons were identified at Godhra railway station itself by their 
relatives.  The dead -bodies of these four persons were handed over to their 
relatives after ident ification.  Five trucks were arranged by the district 
administration for the transportation of the dead bodies. Shri Jaydeep 
Patel has stated to have met the lady collector of Godhra around 23.30 or 
24.00 hours. A police escort had accompanied the dead bod ies from 
Godhra and on the way to Ahmedabad the escorts from the concerned 
districts joined. The convoy reached Sola Civil Hospital, Sola, Ahmedabad 
between 0330 hours to 04.00 hours on 28.02.2002. At Sola Civil Hospital, 
a lady doctor, PI Shri Lathia of S ola Police station, Shri Prajapati, Deputy 
Collector, Collector and Mamlatdar were present. There were several other 
administrative and police officials present there, whose names he does 
not recollect. He handed over the letter to Shri Prajapati, Deputy C ollector. 
Thereafter, the police and administrative officials got busy with the 
preparation of panchnama and other papers.  
Further investigation revealed  that the relatives of the persons, 
who had died in the Godhra carnage, were also present in the 
hospit al. Accordingly, 35 persons were identified and their dead 
bodies handed over to their relatives by about 1300 hrs on 28 -02-
2002 by the police after obtaining the receipts from them. It may be 
mentioned here that 25 dead bodies were claimed by the resident s 
of Ahmedabad, two (2) by the residents of Kadi, Mehsana, five (5) by 
the residents of Anand, two (2) by the residents of Khedbramha, 
Sabarkantha and one (1) from Rajkot. The photographs and DNA 
samples of the remaining unidentified 19 dead bodies were ta ken by 
the hospital authorities. These 19 unidentified dead bodies were 
cremated on 28 -02-2002 evening, at Gota cremation ground nearer 
to the Sola Civil Hospital by the District Administrative and Police 
officers with the help of Surpanch of Gota village.  The cremation was 
completed by about 1830 hrs on 28 -02-2002 . 
Shri Narendra Modi, Chief Minister had earlier stated that Shri 
Jaydeep Patel, the then VHP General Secretary was known to him.  
However, he does not remember to have met him at Godhra. Accordin g to 
Shri Modi, after the decision was taken to transport the dead bodies to 
Ahmedabad, it was the duty of the District Administration to chalk out 
the modalities for its transportation.  
It may thus be seen that the journey from Godhra to Ahmedabad 
started around midnight and the dead bodies reached Sola Civil Hospital 382  
 
sometime between 0330 to 0400 hrs and there was no one on the highway 
at that point of time in the night to see them. Furt her, though a letter had 
been addressed by Shri M. L. Nalvaya in the name of Shri Jaydeep Patel 
of VHP and the dead bodies were acknowledged by Shri Hasmukh T. Patel 
of VHP, yet the dead bodies were escorted by the police upto Sola Civil 
Hospital, Ahmedaba d situated on the outskirts of Ahmedabad City. At 
Sola Civil Hospital, Shri Jaydeep Patel handed over the letter to the 
hospital authorities and the local police as well as the hospital authorities 
took charge of the dead bodies.  Subsequently, 35 dead bod ies were 
handed over to the legal heirs/guardians of the deceased by  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 434 
 
the police after preparing the panchnama and documentation. The 19 
unidentified dea d bodies were cremated on the same evening by the local 
administration and police authorities at Gota cremation ground nearby 
with the help of Sarpanch of Gota village after retaining their DNA 
samples. Subsequently, 12 dead bodies could be identified afte r 
conducting DNA tests, while the remaining seven (7) remained 
unidentified.  
The above facts would go to establish that though a letter had 
been addressed by Mamalatdar, Godhra to Shri Jaydeep Patel of VHP, 
yet the dead bodies were escorted by the police f rom Godhra to 
Ahmedabad, where the same were taken charge of by the hospital 
authorities, District Administrative and Police Officers and handed 
over to the kith and kin of deceased persons after taking proper 
receipt. Shri M.L. Nalvaya, Mamalatdar had act ed in an irresponsible 
manner by issuing a letter in the name Shri Jaydeep Patel in token 
of having handed over the dead bodies which were case properly, and 
therefore, the Govt. of Gujarat is being requested to initiate 
departmental proceedings against hi m. 
 
➢ Observations made by Ld. Amicus Curiae : 
The positioning of 2 Cabinet Ministers having nothing to do with 
the home portfolio in the Office of DGP and the State police Control 
Room respectively is another circumstance which reflects that there 
was a direct instruction from the Chief Minister. Though Shri 
383  
 
Jadeja says that he had gone to the DGP's office on instructions of 
Shri Gordhan Zadafia, MoS (Home) this is highly unbelievable. It is 
obvious that the Chief Minister had positioned these 2 Ministers  in 
highly sensitive places which should not have been done. Infact, 
these 2 Ministers could have taken active steps to defuse the riots, 
but they did nothing, which speaks volumes about the decision to 
let the riots happen. It does not appear that these 2  Ministers 
immediately called CM and told him about the situation at Gulberg 
and other places.  
SIT merely relied upon the statement of the police officers to 
conclude that these 2 Ministers did not give any instructions to 
Police department, but it appears  highly unlively that 2 Cabinet 
Ministers of the Government of Gujarat would have not given some 
kind of directions when CM had directed them to remain present . 
It is obvious that the 2 Ministers were fully aware of the developing 
situation in Gulberg Soci ety, Naroda Patiya etc, in Ahmedabad City. 
They were duty bound to convey the situation to the Chief Minister 
and were required to do everything possible to save loss of lives. If 
the stand of CM that these 2 Ministers were positioned so as to 
effectively control the law and order situation is correct, then there 
would have been a far quicker action to control the riots in Gulberg 
Society and Naroda Patiya atleast . 
 
Result of further investigation : 
Further investigation has been conducted into the allegatio n 
relating to the. positioning of Shri I.K. Jadeja, the then Urban 
Development Minister in the State Police Control Room, DGP's office and 
Late Ashok Bhatt, the then Health Minister in the Ahmedabad City Police 
Control Room.  
Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP has stated during further 
investigation that Shri Ashok Narayan, ACS (Home) informed him that it 
was decided by the Govt. that Shri I.K. Jadeja, the then Minister would 
be in his office to secure some information about the law & order situation 
in the State as State Control Room is situated in DGP's office. Shri Ashok 
Narayan had further informed him that Late Ashok Bhatt another 
Minister would sit in Ahmedabad City Police Control Room. Shri 
Chakravarthi has further stated that he had his own reservatio ns in this 
matter and, therefore, he advised the ACS (Home) that it would be better, 
if these Ministers got the information from the Control Room in the Home 384  
 
Department. However, Shri Ashok Narayan informed him that no such 
facility was available with him in the Home Department and, therefore, 
the two Ministers would come to the respective Control Rooms.  
According to Shri Chakravarthi, Shri I.K, Jadeja, the then Minister 
came to his office in the forenoon of 28 -02-2002 and sat in his chamber 
for about 15 -20 minutes. Shri Chakravarthi could not attend to him, as 
he was awfully busy with the telephone calls being received by him from 
all over the State. According to his recollection, he had asked someone to 
shift the Minister  
 
-------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 435 
 
to an empty chamber in his office and this was done. He has also stated 
that he was not aware as to what Shri Jadeja did while he was in the 
DGP's office as he was extremely busy with his work on that day as rioting 
was taking place at many locations. Later, Shr i Chakravarthi came to 
know that Shri Jadeja had left his office. Shri Chakravarthi has 
categorically stated that his enquiries with the staff of the State Control 
Room had revealed that Shri Jadeja did not interfere  with the functioning 
of the Control Roo m in any manner.  
Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP, Ahmedabad City has stated that it 
was incorrect to say that Shri Ashok Bhatt, the then Health Minister 
remained stationed at Shahibaug Control Room on 28 -02-2002 to guide 
the police force in controlling the law & order situation . He specifically 
asserted that Shri Bhatt did not visit CP's office Control Room on 28 -02-
2002. He has further stated that Shri George Fernandes, the then Union 
Defence Minister arrived at Ahmedabad on 28 -02-2002 night . Shri 
Fernandes reached CP's office on 01 -03-2002 around 1000 or 1030 hrs 
and asked Shri Pande about the deployment of Army, to which the latter 
said that he would check up the same from the Control Room. Both of 
them went to the Control Room downstairs.  According to Shri Pande, 
Shri Ashok Bhatt, who had been waiting for Shri Fernandes in the Circuit 
House, also came to CP's office to meet Shri Fernandes and entered the 
Control Room.  Shri Pande has also stated that Shri Fernandes and Shri 
Ashok Bhatt rem ained in the Control Room for about ten minutes and 
then left CP's office. According to Shri Pande, during this visit to the 
Control Room, some of the press and media persons were also present 
and as such it was somehow made to appear that Shri Ashok Bhatt  had 
385  
 
come to monitor the Control Room. Finally, Shri Pande has stated that 
Shri Ashok Bhatt was never deputed to Shahibaug Police Control Room 
to assist the police.  
According to Shri Ashok Narayan, he does not recall any 
instructions given by the Chief Min ister, which were conveyed by him 
either to the DGP or CP, Ahmedabad City to the effect that Shri Ashok 
Bhatt and Shri I.K.Jadeja would sit in the Ahmedabad City Police Control 
Room, Shahibaug and State Control Room, Gandhinagar respectively to 
assist/help  the police.  
Shri I.K. Jadeja, the then Urban Development Minister has stated 
that it was an established norm in Gujarat State that in case of any 
natural calamities or serious law & order situation the Ministers of 
various departments extend their help in  handling the crisis. According 
to his recollection on 28 -02-2002, he had volunteered himself, if he could 
be of any help in the prevalent situation, to which Shri Gordhan Zadafia, 
the then MoS (Home) had told him to remain present in the Police Bhavan 
and  to see that in case any information was received in the State Control 
Room about any rioting incident and any information was received 
seeking extra police force, then the same should be passed on to the Home 
Department. Consequent to these instructions, he went to DGP's office 
around 1100 hrs and stayed there for 2 -3 hours. He has stated to have 
interacted with the DGP and informed him that if and when his help was 
required he could ask him. He has denied to have entered the State Police 
Control Room and has stated that there was no question of any 
interference. However, Shri Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home) has 
denied to have any given any suggestion to Shri I.K. Jadeja. He has further 
stated to have visited the DGP's office on the next one or two day s also, 
but stayed there for few minutes only. He has also stated that the DGP 
had not shared any information with him and therefore, he left Police 
Bhavan in few minutes on both these occasions.  
Late Ashok Bhatt had earlier stated that he might have visit ed 
Ahmedabad City Control Room for about 5 -10 minutes on 28 -02-2002. 
However, he has denied to have interfered with the police work, as being 
a senior minister he had to maintain his dignity and status. Again on 01 -
03-2002, he admitted to have visited the Shahibaug Control Room for 
about 10 minutes to meet Shri George Fernandes, who had gone to CP's 
office. The call detail records of mobile phone no. 9825039877 of Late 
Ashok Bhatt show that he returned from Godhra to Ahmedabad on 28 -
02-2002, at about 05:16: 51 hrs. Thereafter, the call details do not show 
its location till 15:50:43 hrs on 28 -02-2002, when the location was traced 386  
 
to Kaba Circle, Gandhinagar. During this period, it is presumed that he 
was at Gandhinagar. His location on 28 -02-2002 at 16:16:37 h rs to 
17:47:22 hrs was shown as Shahibaug Kedar Tower, Ahmedabad City, 
which would conclusively prove that during this period he attended CM's 
press conference at Circuit House Annexe, Shahibaug, Ahmedabad City. 
Thereafter, again the location was seen at 1 7:59:22 hrs at Koba Circle, 
Gandhinagar, which shows that he was returning to Gandhinagar.  These 
call details would go to show that he did not visit Shahibaug Police Control 
Room on 28 -02-2002.  
 
------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------  
Page: 436 
 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DC (Int.) has stated that he had attended 
a meeting at CM's residence on 28 -02-2002 along with the DGP and ADGP 
(Int.). After the meeting, he returned to his chamber on the second floor 
of Police Bhavan at about 1100 hrs and shortly thereafter went to meet 
the DGP on the first floor of the same building. When he entered DGP's 
chamber he found that as instructed after the conclusion of CM's meeting, 
two Cabinet Ministers of Gujarat, namely , Shri Ashok Bhatt and Shri I .K. 
Jadeja had already arrived and were sitting on a sofa -set in DGP's 
chamber. He further stated that Shri G.C. Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.) 
and Shri Maniram, the then Addl. DG (Law & order) were also present 
there. Shri S anjiv Bhatt briefed DGP and after taking tea, he returned to 
his chamber. Shortly thereafter, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt happened to go to State 
Control Room on first floor to collect some documents and saw Shri I.K. 
Jadeja and his supporting staff sitting in the c hamber of Dy.SP, Control 
Room. Finding this a little odd, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt went to DGP and 
informed him that it would be improper to permit outsiders in the State 
Control Room and asked him whether the Minister and his supporting 
staff could be shifted fr om the State Control Room. DGP agreed with him 
and thereafter, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt again went to Control Room and 
requested Shri I.K. Jadeja to accompany him as his presence in the 
Control Room would hamper the smooth functioning of the State Control 
Room, d uring such a critical period, whereupon the latter got up and 
followed him. According to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, he took Shri Jadeja, 
Minister to the chamber of Shri P.C. Thakur, the then IGP, which was 
empty at that time and requested him to make himself comfo rtable and 
contact them for any assistance/requirement. Shri Chakravarthi was 
informed about it. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has also stated that subsequently he 
387  
 
learnt that Shri Jadeja left the Police Bhavan sometime in the afternoon, 
after having lunch. Shri Sanji v Bhatt is not aware about the visit of Shri 
Jadeja in the Police Bhavan on the subsequent days.  
During further investigation, Shri Nissar Mohammad Malik, the 
then PSI, who was on duty in the Police Control Room, Ahmedabad City 
from 28 -02-2002 at 0800 hrs to 02 -03-2002 at 0800 hrs, has stated that 
Shri George Fernandes, the then Union Defence Minister and Shri Harin 
Pathak, the then MoS for Defence had come to Police Control Room, 
Ahmedabad City at 1005 hrs on 01 -03-2002, and left at 1025 hrs. He has 
confir med the wireless message in this regards to be under his signature. 
He has denied knowledge about the visit of Late Ashok Bhatt, the then 
Health Minister to the Police Control Room either on 28 -02-2002 or 01 -
03-2002. Shri. V.R. Patel, the then PSI has also  denied the visit of Late 
Ashok Bhatt, the then Health Minister to the Police Control Room either 
on 28 -02-2002 or 01 -03-2002.  
Shri V.R. Patel, the then PSI has also denied the visit of Late Ashok 
Bhatt, the then Health Minister to the Ahmedabad City Polic e Control 
Room either on 28 -02-2002 or 01 -03-2002.  
Shri Parbatsinh A. Dholetar, the then PSI, Ahmedabad City Police 
Control Room, who was on duty on 28 -02-2002 from 0800 hrs to 1200 
hrs and 2000 hrs to 2400 hrs, has denied the visit of any Minister to the 
Police Control Room.  
Shri Maganbhai M. Limbachia, the then PI, who was on duty from 
0800 hrs to 2000 hrs on 01 -03-2002 in State Police Control Room, Police 
Bhavan Gandhinagar, has denied the visit of any Minister in the Control 
Room.  
It may thus be seen th at Shri K. Chakravarthi has categorically 
stated that Shri I.K. Jadeja did visit his office, but did not go to the 
State Control Room and he was made to sit in an empty chamber. 
Shri I.K. Jadeja himself has confirmed tha t he was shifted to an 
empty chamber  near DGP's chamber and that DGP did not share any 
information with him. Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP has 
confirmed that Shri Jadeja did not interfere with their work.  
Shri I.K. Jadeja has taken the plea that it is an established 
practice in Gujarat State that in case of any natural calamities or 
serious law & order situation the Ministers of the various 
departments extend their help in handling the crisis. Late Ashok 
Bhatt had admitted earlier that he might have visited Ahmedabad 
City Police Control Room on 28 -02-2002 for a few minutes, but the 388  
 
call detail records of his official mobile phone show his location at 
Shahibaug Kedar Tower between 16:16:37 and 17:47:22 on 28 -02-
2002, when he attended CM's press conference.  This would 
conclusively prove that he did not visit the Police Control Room on 
28-02-2002. Moreover, the officials of Ahmedabad City Police 
Control Room have denied that Late Ashok Bhatt ever visited the 
said Control Room either on 28 -02-2002 or 01 -03-2002. In view of 
the aforesa id position, it is established that Shri I.K. Jadeja did visit 
DGP's office, but did not enter the State Control Room or interfere 
with the working of the police and the DGP also did  
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------

not share any information with him. However, it could not be 
established that Late Ashok Bhatt visited Ahmedabad City Police 
Control Room either on 28 -02-2002 or 01 -03-2002. As per his own 
admission he might have visited the C ontrol Room for a few minutes 
on 28 -02-2002 and/or 01 -03-2002. Therefore, the allegation that the 
two Ministers were positioned in the State Control Room and 
Ahmedabad City Police Control Room by the Chief Minister is not 
established.  Significantly, Shri I.K. Jadeja remained at State Police 
headquarters for 2/3 hours as per his own admission but did not 
interfere in the police functioning. Late Ashok Batt's presence in the 
City Police headquarters on the relevant day, if any, was very 
negligible and it can not be termed of any material value. In the 
absence of documentary/oral evidence of any directions given by 
these two Min ister IO Police officials, it can not be said at this stage 
that they conspired in the preparation of riots or did not take any 
action to control the riots.  
 
Observation made by Ld. Amicus Curiae : 
No tangible action seems to have been taken by the police high ups 
in the Police Department, namely Commissioner of Police, to control 
the riots at Gulberg Society. Gulberg Society is not very far away 
from the Office of Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad.  
 
389  
 
Result of further investigation : 
Further investigation conducted about the role played by Shri P.C. 
Pande, the then Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City revealed that 
on 27-02-2002, Shri Pande remained in the office till late in the night as 
well as in the early hours of 28 -2-2002. During this period, he had 
informally discussed the law & order situation and the arrangements to 
be made on 28 -2-2002, with Shri Shivanand Jha , the then Addl. CP, 
Sector -1 and Shri M.K. Tondon, the then Jt.  CP, Sector -II. On 28 -2-2002, 
Shri Pande came to office around 08:00 hrs. After sometime, he came to 
know that the dead bodies of victims of Godhra incident had been brought 
to Sola Civil Hosp ital and that some kind of dispute/altercation was going 
on and the atmosphere was tense at Sola Civil Hospital. Accordingly, Shri 
P.C. Pande went to Sola Civil Hospital around 10:00 hrs and found that 
the doctors were under pressure to complete the docume ntation whereas 
the relatives of the victims were in a hurry to take the dead bodies. 
However, Shri Pande did not find anything alarming and, therefore, 
returned to his office at about 11:00 hrs.  
On the way, he found that the mobs had assembled at many pla ces 
in large numbers, but they were not violent and most of them being 
spectators. While Shri Pande sat in his office, the reports started pouring 
in from all parts of the city about stone pelting, arson, looting and 
damaging of properties. He does not exa ctly remember, but whenever any 
information came to him about any incident or any distress call was 
received from any individual the same was promptly attended and the 
information immediately passed on to the concerned officer with 
instructions to attend t o it on priority basis. The Control Room was 
flooded with numerous calls for help and as such with the available force 
it was not possible to effectively deal with all the situations. It may be 
mentioned here that on that day many distress calls had been r eceived 
from Police Station areas like Satellite, Navrangpura, Ellisbridge, 
Bapunangar, Amraiwadi, Meghaninagar , Naroda and Odhav, which had 
comparatively faced lesser communal problems in the past. A few calls 
had been received from walled city as well na mely Shahpur in particular, 
but the extent of damage was much less. Keeping in view the gravity of 
the situation curfew was declared in many parts of the city from 1220 hrs 
onwards.  
As far as Shri P.C. Pande recollects, he had instructed Shri M.K. 
Tandon, the then Jt. CP, Sector II on 28 -2-2002 forenoon, to go to 
Meghaninagar as some calls of crowd gathering and stone pelting etc were 
being received in the Control Room Meghaninagar P.S. area. He has stated 390  
 
that he did not know Late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP perso nally and also did 
not have knowledge that he was residing in Gulberg society till 28 -02-
2002 afternoon.  
Shri P.C. Pande had earlier stated that Shri M.K. Tandon, Jt. CP, 
Sector -II had reached Naroda Patiya around 12:30 hours and had Spoken 
to him over mob ile phone that the situation was alarming and 
recommended that curfew should be declared in the Naroda P.S. area. He 
concurred with the advice of Shri Tandon and curfew was declared in 
Naroda P.S. area at about 12:30 hrs. Shri Pande has also stated that 
Ahmedabad City was totally disturbed and communication as well as 
transport system had come to standstill.  According to Shri Pande, the 
additional force wherever sent was unable to reach in time because the 
roads had been  
 
--------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 438 
 
blocked/obstructed by the rioters by putting different kind of obstacles 
and large crowds had collected making movement difficult.  
On 28 -2-2002 at about 12:20 hrs, a message was sent by PI 
Meghaninagar P.S. in the Control Room that Gulberg society in 
Meghaninagar area which is a Muslim society had been surrounded by a 
mob of 10,000, which was pelting stones and also setting fire to sh ops 
nearby and rickshaws. He requested for additional officers police 
personnel and SRP immediately. On receipt of this message, Shri P.C. 
Pande deputed three officers namely Shri G.D. Solanki, Dy. SP, Group -
VII, Shri Ajitkumar Gupta, Dy. SP, Group -XII and  Shri A.B. Qureshi, PI, 
CID Crime to go to Gulberg society for the assistance of PI Meghaninagar.  
At about 13:45 hrs. one section of CISF was also sent to Gulberg society, 
Meghaninagar.  At 1405 hrs., Shri M.K. Tondon, Jt. CP, Sector -II sent a 
message to the Police Control Room that Late Ahesan Jafri Ex -MP and 
others had been surrounded by the mob in Gulberg society and extra force 
and PI, Sardarnagar be sent there to shift them. At 14:14 hrs, another 
message was sent by Senior PI Erda, Meghaninagar P.S. i n the Police 
Central Room that a mob of about 10,000 persons had gathered at 
Gulberg society/Kalapinagar and was about to set fire to the entire society 
and as such ACP, DCP along with additional force be sent immediately. 
At 14:45 hrs, Shri K.G. Erda, Sr. PI Meghaninagar sent another message 
to the Control Room that in the Gulberg society in Meghaninagar area, 
391  
 
the Muslims had been surrounded by a mob of 10,000 persons from all 
the sides and even the police force had also been surrounded and that 
the mob was  about to set fire to the society. Shri Erda requested for 
additional SRP and police force to be sent as the situation was critical . 
Since, two Dy. SsP, One PI and one section of CISF had already been sent 
to Gulberg society, no additional force was sent a s nothing was available 
as reserves. Shri Pande contacted Shri P.B. Gondia, the then DCP, Zone -
IV at 15:16 hrs and told him that Muslims were being burnt in the 
Gulberg Society and that he should reach there immediately. However, 
Shri Gondia reached Gulber g Society only at 1605 hrs. At about 15:45 
hrs, Shri M.K. Tandon, the then Jt. CP, Sector -II though fully aware of 
the situation at Gulberg Society sent a message to Ahmedabad City Police 
Control Room asking as to whether there was any incident relating to  loss 
of life at Gulberg society at Meghaninagar and thereof a detailed report be 
sent to him. No other information was available with the Control Room at 
that time. Shri Pande has also stated that Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then 
DGP had also informed him t hat a mob had surrounded the Gulberg 
Society and that reinforcements should be sent there, to which he had 
informed  him that extra force and officers had already been sent to 
Gulberg Society in Meghaninagar P.S. area.  However, Shri Pande has 
claimed that he did not know as to when the additional police force sent 
by him had actually reached Gulberg Society. He has stated that he had 
come to know about  the incident at Gulberg Society sometime in the 
evening and as such personally visited the society sometim e between 
19:00 hrs to 19:30 hrs. Shri Pande found that the houses were ransacked 
and belongings set on fire and some wooden articles/furniture etc. was 
still smoldering. According to Shri Pande, since the Jt. CP had already 
shifted most of the inmates of the society in vans to safer places, he gave 
instructions to the Sr. PI and other staff present over there to go ahead 
with the inquest and send the dead bodies for post -mortem examination. 
He returned to office thereafter.  
As per Shri Pande, Late Ahesan J afri, Ex -MP did not contact him 
either on his landline phone or mobile phone on 28 -2-2002, seeking help. 
No one else from Gulberg society contacted him either on his landline or 
mobile phone seeking help on 28 -2-2002. The call detail records of official 
mobile phone no. 98250 48303 of Shri Pande have been scrutinised and 
the same does not show any call from the landline no. 2125166 of Late 
Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP. Shri Pande has further stated that as per his 
information, Late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP did not have a ny mobile phone and 
there was no other landline in Gulberg Society.  392  
 
Shri Pande has added that on 28 -2-2002, requests were received 
from different police stations areas seeking additional force/S RP and 
whatever resources were available with him, the same we re dispatched to 
them . However, he found that no feedback had been received from anyone 
of them. This led him to presume that the additional force reached them 
in time and that they were able to control the situation.  Shri Pande is 
also of the view that s imilar was the case of Gulberg Society where initially 
three officers, two Dy. SsP and one Pl and subsequently one section of 
CISF was sent by him.  
Shri Pande also stated that on 28 -2-2002 around 2 o'clock in the 
afternoon, he heard a noise outside the CP' s office. He immediately 
checked and found that a dargah adjoining CP office had been attacked 
by a mob. Since, there was no other force available with him, he  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Pag e: 439 
 
personally came down and went to the spot along with his gunman . He 
has claimed to have dispersed the mob almost single handedly and waited 
there for sometime to ensure that the mob did not re -assemble. By this 
timely action, the dargah could be sa ved from the rioters.  
Shri P .C. Pande has stated that the circumstances did not exist on 
27-2-2002 or even 28 -2-2002 to variant the imposition of curfew, in 
Ahmedabad City and any hasty action would have led to the panic in the 
city. He has further stated  that even otherwise with limited force available 
enforcement of curfew poses serious problems and large scale breach 
becomes common.  According to Shri Pande, as and when the sector 
commanders reported over phone about the seriousness of the situation 
at any place, he immediately concurred over telephone and ordered for 
the imposition as well as enforcement of the curfew. As per Shri Pande, 
almost the whole of the city was under curfew by noon time. In view of 
this, there does not seem to be any deliberate  and gross negligence on his 
part.  
Shri Nisar Mohd. Malik, the then PSI, Police Control Room, 
Ahmedabad City, who was on Police Control Room duty from 0800 hrs on 
28-02-2002 to 0800 hrs on 02 -03-2002, has stated that he was not aware 
or any communications of Shri P. C. Pande, the then CP, Shri M. K. 
Tandon, the then Jt. CP, Sector -II Shri Shivanand Jha, the then Addl. CP, 
393  
 
Sector -I or any other officer on 28 -02-2002 and 01 -03-2002, which might 
have suggested/instructed for inaction on the part of police whil e dealing 
with the Hindu rioters. He has further stated that the 
instructions/messages of the senior officers, which were passed through 
Ahmedabad City Police Control Room, were for taking all the required 
measures to control the riots and prevent any unto ward incident. Shri 
Malik has also stated that Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP had visited the 
Police Control Room and passed on the instructions personally to the 
jurisdictional officers to use effective force and control the riots. He does 
not remember the exact date and time of the said message passed on by 
Shri Pande, but had noted down the said instructions in the message 
register of PCR, Ahmedabad City. He has also stated that as and when CP 
was made aware of messages regarding law & order situation, he had 
passed necessary instructions such as imposition of curfew and 
deployment of manpower. Shri Malik has denied the visit of Late Ashok 
Bhatt, the then Health Minister to the Control Room.  
Shri V.R. Patel another PSI, who was on duty in Ahmedabad City 
Police Control Room from 0800 hrs on 28 -02-2002 to 0800 hrs on 02 -03-
2002 has fully corroborated the statement of Shri Nissarmohmad Malik, 
the then PSI.  
Shri Shivanand Jha, the then Addl. CP. Sector -l, Ahmedabad City 
had stated that there were no instructions  from any of the senior officers 
not to act or to allow the Hindus to vent their anger.  
Shri M.K. Tandon, the then Jt. CP, Sector -II had also stated that no 
such instructions were given by any of the senior officers to allow the 
Hindus to vent their anger against Muslims in the light of Godhra carnage 
and that the police should not act against them. Shri Tondon has further 
stated that on the contrary the instructions were given to deal with the 
situation firmly.  
Shri Pande has explained that the mobs had sw elled to such an 
extent that they openly defied the curfew orders and as and when 
they were challenged by the police, they hid themselves in the lanes 
and after the police left they regrouped. He is also of the considered 
opinion that this had happened due  to the inadequate number of 
policeman on duty and those present could not leave the places 
where they were deputed. He stated that the police force was engaged 
in a particular area, the mobs concentrated on other areas. Similarly, 
the fire tenders sent to  Gulberg society and Naroda could not reach 
there in time due to obstacles put on by the rioters resulting in loss 
of life and property in these areas. He has also mentioned that the 394  
 
Meghaninagar and Naroda P.S. had never been communally sensitive 
in the p ast and as such the attacks in Naroda Patiya and Gulberg 
society were beyond their expectations. In view of the aforesaid 
position, the allegation that Shri Pande did not take adequate actions 
to control the situation at Gulberg Society is not established.  
 
Observation made by Ld. Amicus Curiae:  
The observation of Shri Modi in a television interview on 01 -03-2002 
clearly indicates that there was an attempt to justify the violence 
against the minority community. This indicates as certain 
approach. The statement made by Shri Modi cannot be seen in 
isolation. It has to  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 440 
 
be seen in conjunction with other facts mentioned hereinabove 
which provides sufficient justification for a detailed investigation 
in the matter.    
 
Result of further investigation:  
During further investigation, a requisition was sent to the Zee 
TV to make available a copy of the CD of a television interview of 
Shri Narendra Modi, Chief Minister, Gujarat conducted by their 
correspondent Shri Sudhir Chaudhary on 01.03.2002. Despite two 
reminders and a notice u/s 91 Cr.P.C. sent to them, the CD has not 
been made available.  
 Shri Sudhir Chaudhary has stated that he attended a press 
conference held by Shri Narendra Modi on 01 -03-2002, at a Circuit 
House on the outskirts of Gandhinagar. He has further stated that 
Shri Narendra Modi was known to him and that he had interviewed 
him earlier several times in Delhi. Shri Sudhir Chaudhary has stated 
to have requested Shri Narendra Modi for a short interview after the 
conference to which the latter agreed and as such he was interviewed 
for about 10 minutes. After going through the Editor's Guild Fact 
Finding Mission report dated 03.05.2002, Shri Chaudhary has stated 
395  
 
that the same were onl y a few excerpts from the said interview and 
that the original CD of the said interview was not before him. As per 
his recollection, he had questioned Shri Narendra Modi about the 
Chamanpura massacre (Gulberg Society Case), in which former 
Congress MP Late  Ahesan Jafri had been killed with many others to 
which the Chief Minister had replied that the mob had reacted on 
account of private firing done by Late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP. After 
refreshing his memory from the Editor's Guild report, Shri Sudhir 
Chaudhary  has stated that the Chief Minister was of the view that he 
neither wanted action nor reaction. He has further stated to have 
questioned the Chief Minister about the wide spread violence post 
Godhra, the Chief Minister stated as follows: - 
"Godhra main jo p arson hua, jahan par chalees (40) 
mahilaon aur bacchon ko zinda jala diya is main desh 
main aur videsh main sadma pahuchna swabhavik tha. 
Godhra ke is  ilake ki criminal tendencies rahi hain. In 
logon ne pahele mahila teachers ka khoon kiya Aur ab yeh 
jagha nya apraadh kiya hai jiski pratikria ho rahi hai".  
 Shri Sudhir Chaudhary has shown his inability to elaborate the 
same as he has not been able to recollect the exact sequence of 
events after a span of 9 years and moreover, the CD was not before 
him.  
Shri  Narendra Modi had been questioned about the aforesaid 
interview given to Zee TV on 01.03.2002. He has stated that those 
who have read the history of Gujarat would definitely be aware that 
communal violence in Gujarat has a long history and the State had 
witnessed serious incidents of such communal violence. As regards 
the Zee TV interview of 01.03.2002 is concerned, Shri Modi has 
stated that after a period of eight years, he did not recollect the exact 
words, but he had always appealed only and only for pe ace. He (Shri 
Modi) had further stated that he had tried to appeal to the people to 
shun violence in straight and simple language. He had also stated 
that if his words cited in this question are considered in the correct 
perspective, then it would be evide nt that there is a very earnest 
appeal for people refraining from any kind of violence. He had denied 
all the allegations against him in this regard.  
 Regarding the statement made to the media about post Godhra 
riots by citing Newton's law that every actio n has equal and opposite 
reaction, Shri Narendra Modi had stated that the Times of India had 
published a news item on 03.03.2002, purportedly as though he had 396  
 
given an interview to them. According to Shri Modi, the truth is that 
nobody had met him in this regard. He had further stated that the 
falsehood of his so -called justification "Action -Reaction Theory" is 
evident from this fact. According to Shri Modi, the State Govt. issued 
a denial with regard to his not having given any interview and the 
same was b elatedly published in a remote corner of the newspaper. 
He had also stated that it had been his considered opinion that 
violence can not be replied by violence and he had appealed for 
peace. As per Shri Modi's version, he had not and would never justify 
any action or reaction by a mob against innocents. He had denied all 
allegations in this regard.  
The recommendations made in Chart ‘B' by the Ld. Amicus 
Curiae vis -a-vis comments of SIT are given below :-

Chart -’B’ 
ALLEGATIONS  FINDINGS  OBSERVATIONS  
VII: The allegation is that 
13 IAS/IPS officers were 
rewarded for their 
support during the post 
Godhra riots.  The finding of the SIT is 
that there was nothing to 
indicate that 13 officers 
had been rewarded with 
postings for their support 
to CM. However, the SIT 
had concluded that the 
conduct of Shri M.K. 
Tandon, the then Jt.CP, 
Sector -Il, Ahmedabad, 
was not satisfactory and 
therefore, Departmental 
Action  be taken against 
them.  1.  As regards, Shri M.K.  
Tandon, the then Jt. 
CP, Sector -Il and Shri 
P.B. Gondia, the then 
DCP, Zone - IV it does 
not appear to be a 
simple case of mere 
dereliction of duty, 
section 304A IPC would 
be squarely attracted in 
such a ca se. 
2. In so far as 
promotion of other IAS 
and IPS officers are 
concerned, the view 
taken by SIT seems to 
be acceptable.  
397  
 
IX. The allegation is that 
the Govt. of Gujarat has 
been seriously indicted -
by this Hon'ble Court due 
to fresh investigation in 
Bilkisbano  case  by CBI 
and retrial of Best Bakery 
Case outside the State of 
Gujarat.  1. The SIT has concluded 
that the trials in both the 
cases are over. Some 
accused have been 
convicted and some 
accused have been 
acquitted and the 
appeals are pending 
before the High Court.  
2. The SIT has 
recommended that the 
matter requires to be  
handled by state of 
Gujarat to take 
depart mental action for 
major penalty against 
Shri K Kumaraswamy, Jt 
CP, Baroda City and Shri 
Ramjibhai Pargi, former 
ACP in light of 
observation of the Ld 
Sessions Judge, Greater 
Bombay. It also 
recommends setting up 
of a Committee by Govt. 
of Gujarat to fix 
responsibility on the 
officials.  1. The investigative 
agencies let off the 
accused in Bilkisbano 
case.  If the CBI had not 
stepped in, the accused 
would have gone 
unpunished. Similarly, 
in Best Bakery case,  it 
appears that the 
prosecution was done 
in a shoddy  manner to 
protect the accused.  
 
2. The 
recommendations of 
the SIT that the Govt. 
of Gujarat should set up 
a committee perhaps 
needs to be 
reconsidered. It would 
be appropriate if these 
two cases are examined 
by SIT so as to fix 
responsibility on the 
inves tigating 
/prosecuting officials 
and suitable directions 
can thereafter be issued 
by this Hon'ble Court to 
take action, either 
under the Indian Penal 
Code (depending on 
whether it reveals 
offences under IPC) or  
departmental action for 
misconduct. The acts 
of the investigating/ 
prosecuting agencies 
may attract Section 
201 IPC.  398  
 
X. The allegation is that 
the investigations were 
partial in nature and 
there was  
 
------------------------------  
Page: 442 
prejudice against the riot 
victims.  The finding of the SIT is 
that Supplementary 
chargesheets have been  
 
 
 
 
filed in Gulberg, Society 
case and Naroda Patiya 
case, but that by itself 
cannot be a reason to 
hold that investigations 
were conducted in a 
partial manner.  The grievance of the 
Petitioner may not 
survive after the SIT 
has conducted  
 
 
 
fresh investigations, 
but it would be unjust 
to spare those people 
who conducted, 
partisan or negligent 
investigation. Hence, 
this issue needs to be 
addressed. The role of 
the officials in the 
Crime Branch, 
especially DCP, 
Vanzara and ACP 
Chudasama needs to be 
inquired into especially 
in the light of the 
statement of Shri Rahul 
Sharma, DCP, Control 
Room, Ahmedabad. To 
that extent the finding 
of SIT  is not 
acceptable.  
399  
 
XV. The allegation is that 
pro VHP lawyers were 
appointed as Public 
Prosecutors, which had 
adverse effect on the trial 
of the riot accused.  The finding of the SIT is 
that though the political 
affiliation of the advocate 
weighed with the 
government in their 
app ointment as Public 
Prosecutors, there is not 
specific allegation in 
showing favour by them 
to any of the accused 
persons involved in the 
riots, either at the time of 
grant of bail or during the 
trial.  The issue may not 
though survive because 
of the interve ntion by 
this Hon'ble Court 
whereby Public  
Prosecutors have been 
appointed in an 
independent manner. 
However, this may be 
required to be looked 
into further in light of 
the subsequent letter of 
Ms. Teesta Setalvad.  
XXI & XXII . These 
allegations relate to  
inaction against senior 
police officers as they did 
not carry out proper 
investigation of riot 
related cases, specially 
the Bilkisbano rape case.  The SIT has stated that 
the allegations were 
vague and general and 
there was nothing 
against any specific 
officer. It is further stated 
that the CBI had not 
recommended any action 
against Shri Jadeja, SP 
Dahod in the Bilkisbano 
case.  In so far as Shri Jadeja 
is concerned, the 
documents relating to 
Bilkisbano case  need 
to be scrutinized by 
SIT.  
 
The basis on whic h the 
CBI has concluded that 
no departmental action 
is required to be taken 
against Mr. Jadeja has 
to be examined before 
any conclusion be 
drawn.  400  
 
XXIII .  The allegation is 
that the CD relating to 
telephonic calls of BJP 
leaders and police 
officers were not looked 
into by the Investigating 
Officers Gulberg  
Society and Naroda 
Patiya.  The SIT has found that 
Shri Tarun Barot, the 
investigating Officer of 
the case and Shri G.L. 
Singhal, the ACP, Crime 
Branch intentionally did 
not examine the cell 
phone records, though it 
was available to them, 
and therefore, major 
penalty departmental 
proceedings should be 
initiated against them.  The Govt. of Gujarat 
may be directed to take 
departmental actions 
against these two 
officers immediately 
within a time b ound 
manner.  401  
 
XXV : The allegation is 
that the police at Gulberg  
 
------------------------------  
Page: 443 
 
Society and Naroda 
Patiya did not take action 
and acted as mute 
spectators to the acts of 
lawlessness. Real 
culprits were not 
arrested and no 
preve ntive action was 
taken.  The SIT has found this 
allegation to be incorrect.  1. Shri M.K. Tandon, 
the then Jt. CP, Sector -  
 
 
 
 
II said that he reached 
Gulberg Society 4.00 
pm and ordered CISF 
firing. It is not clear 
why CISF could  not 
reach earlier, though it 
had been sent at 1:45 
pm. It is not clear why 
the other officers, 
namely G.D. Solanki, 
Dy.SP etc. could not 
reach Gulberg Society 
on time. It appears that 
nothing was done by 
the police personnel 
present at Gulberg 
Society and Naroda 
Patiya to dispel the 
gathering mob. It would 
appear that the mob 
was being permitted to 
gather at these two 
places. Hence, there is 
substance in the 
allegations of police 
inaction.  
 
2. It is not clear what 
action was taken by 
Shri M.T. Rana, the

The aforesaid recommendations of the Ld. Amicus Curiae would 
show that he concurred with the findings of SIT with regard to Allegations 
No.lX & XXIII. Further, as regards Allegation No. XV, Ld. Amicus Curiae 
has opined that the issue may not survive becaus e of the intervention of 
the Hon'ble Supreme Court, whereby Public Prosecutors have been 
appointed in an independent manner.  
The recommendations made by Ld Amicus Curiae in Chart - 'B' 
have been examined and the comments on the same were as follows: - 
 
SPE CIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SIT:  
Observation made by Ld. Amicus Curiae:  
Shri M.K. Tondon and Shri P.B. Gondia be prosecuted u/s 304A IPC.  
 
Result of further investigation:  
Ld. Amicus Curiae has recommended that Shri M.K.Tandon (the 
then Joint Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad city) and Shri P.B 
Gondia (the then Deputy Commissioner of Police, Ahmadabad City)

record [after further investigation of three cases (Meghaninagar 
Police Station I.CR No.67/2002, Naroda Police Station I.CR Nos. 
100/2002 & 98/2002)] against Shri Tandon and Shri Gondia was 
analysed and it was found that the same is not adequate to launch 
prosecution of the above two officers. For understanding the issue in 
hand, details of this case s/evidence are given below : 
 
Brief facts :  
(I) Meghaninagar P. Stn. I. CR No.67/2002 (Gulberg Society):  
A call for Gujarat Bandh on 28.02.2002 was given by VHP, which 
was supported by ruling -BJP, to protest against the killing of Karsevaks 
at Godhra Railway Station on 27.02.2002. An unlawful mob of around 
20,000 Hindus, armed with deadly weapons attacked shops and houses 
of Muslims residing in Gulberg Society on 28.02.2002 morning

Facts/Sequence of  events establish during investigation:  
Enquiry by Shri A. K. Malhotra, Member, SIT / earlier investigation 
/ further investigation has established the following:  
(A) Shri M. K. Tandon was Joint Commissioner of Police, Sector -Il, 
Ahmedabad City during the relevant period. Sector -Il comprises 3 Zones 
(Zone -IV, V & VI) and covered 15 police stations including Meghaninagar 
and Naroda . Certain police stations in his jurisdiction namely, Dariapur, 
Gomtipur; Rakhial and Bapunagar were traditionally communally 
sen sitive while Meghaninagar and Naroda did not have history of serious 
communal riots though these also had a few Muslim pockets. Each Zone 
is headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP). Shri P. B. Gondia 
was posted as DCP Zone -IV, who had jurisdiction over Meghaninagar, 
Naroda  Dariapur, Shahibaug and Sardarnagar Police stations.  
(B) Though Shri Tandon had received information regarding Godhra 
train incident as well as the proposed VHP Bandh on 28.02.2002 on the 
morning of 27.02.2002 itself, he did not held any formal meeting with 
DCsP/SHOs or chalked out any plan to handle the law and order situation 
on the coming day. In fact, no major preventive police action was taken. 
Similarly, no meeting of SHOs/chalking out of law and order plan was 
done by Shri P. B.Gondia, DCP.  
(C) Shri Tand on was allotted 1 Coy of State Reserve Police (SRP) for the 
Bandh day, which was distributed among 3 DC sP (1 Platoon each). During 
his movements on 28.02.2002. Shri Tandon was having a Striking Force 
comprising 2 Police Sub -Inspectors and a few armed men i n 2 vehicles.  
(D) In the morning of 28.02.2002, Shri M. K. Tandon left for Dariapur 
P.S. as it was considered communally very sensitive. On the way around 
1035 hours, he received a wireless message from Assistant Commissioner 
of Police, 'G' division reque sting Police Control Room to send more vehicles 
to Naroda Patiya area. In view of this message, he changed his route 
towards Naroda Patiya. En route, he inquired about location of Sr. PI of 
Meghaninagar P.S. and after having learnt that he had gone to Gulb erg 
Society due to some problem there, he proceeded towards the same and 
reached there around 1130 hours.  
In the meantime, Shri P. B. Gondia, DCP received information 
regarding trouble at Naroda Patiya/ Naroda Gaam and reached Naroda 
Patiya at about 1100 hours. Inspector Shri Mysorewala of Naroda P.S, 406  
 
and ACP Shri M. T. Rana were already there to deal with mob which had 
gathered in large numbers.  
(E) Shri M K. Tandon found a mob of around 1,000 Hindu rioters 
around Gulberg Society and ordered for burs ting of tear gas shells and 
lathi charge by his Striking Force. Official records suggest that six tear 
gas shells were fired by the Striking Force attached to Shri Tandon at that 
time. As a result, the mob got dispersed in the lanes/by -lanes near 
Gulberg S ociety. It is believed that Shri Tandon also met late Shri Ahesan 
Jafri, ex -MP and certain other residents of Gulberg Society who were 
assured of strengthening the police presence there. Though witnesses 
claim that Late Ahesan Jafri had met the Commissione r, investigation has 
revealed that Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP, Ahmedabad City had not 
visited the Gulberg Society at that time. So most likely, Late Jafri had met 
Shri M. K. Tandon, the then Jt. CP, Sector -Il. However, Shri Tandon 
denies this fact. Aroun d 1150 hours Shri M. K. Tandon left for Naroda 
Patiya.  
(F) On reaching Naroda Patiya area around 1220 hours Shri Tandon 
found the situation to be very explosive and requested Commissioner of 
Police for imposition of curfew in Naroda Patiya. The Commissione r of 
Police, Ahmedabad City agreed with the request made by Shri Tandon and 
curfew was imposed at 1230 hrs.  
(G) Significantly , Shri P. B. Gondia received a massage at 1235 hrs from 
Sr. PI, Meghaninagar about the grave situation at Gulberg Society where 
a m ob of around 5,000 had reportedly gathered.  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 446 
 
(H) Around 1240 hours, Shri M. K. Tandon left Naroda Patiya for 
Dariapur Police Station area ostensibly on th e ground that it was 
communally hyper sensitive. Incidentally, Shri Tandon did not take any 
concrete action, at Naroda Patiya except requesting for imposition of 
curfew. As per call detail records he was in Bapunagar -Rakhial area 
between 1241 hrs and 1325 hrs. Further, he remained in Dariapur and 
Kalupur Police Stations area between 1351 hours and 1542 hours.  
(I) At about 1220 hrs and 1230 hrs, Sr. P I Erda of Meghaninagar P.S . 
sent alarming messages to Police Control Room about the critical 
situation at Gul berg Society requesting for reinforcements.  
407  
 
(J) Around 1405 hrs, Shri Tandon sent a message to Control Room to 
send additional force for shifting Late Ahesan Jafri and others who had 
been surrounded by a mob in the Gulberg Society. Shri Tandon did not 
both er to inquire about the latest position till 1545 hrs when he asked 
Control Room to check -up as to whether there was any incident relating 
to loss of life in Gulberg Society. By that time, the Society had been set 
ablaze and lot of lives including that of Late Ahesan Jafri had been lost.  
(K) Shri. P. B. Gondia sent Shri V. S. Gohil,  IInd Police Inspector, 
Naroda P.S. to Naroda Gaam around 1300 hrs due to critical situation 
there. He also ordered police firing in Naroda Patiya area, which resulted 
in death of 1 Hindu and 1 Muslim miscreant. As per police records, during 
this period, 48 rounds (22 rounds of 9 mm + 26 rounds of 303) as well as 
95 tear gas shells were fired by the Striking Force of Shri P.B. Gondia. He 
left Naroda Patiya at 14:20 hrs ostensibly  to go to Pithadiya Bambha 
(Dariapur P.S.) in view of some trouble there. (However, in a signed 
statement made earlier in point of time to Shri A.K Malhotra, Member, SIT 
during inquiry, he has claimed that he had left for Hotel Moti Manor 
owned by a Muslim  and Rosary School in Shahibaug area, which were 
being set on fire).  
(L)  On way to Pithadiya Bambha, Shri P. B. Gondia received 
instructions from CP Ahmedabad City at 1516 hrs to go to Gulberg Society 
and he reached there sometime around 1600 hrs. Shri M .K. Tandon 
arrived at Gulberg Society thereafter and arranged for prisoner vans, 
ambulances etc. for safe shifting of 150 survivors of Gulberg Society to 
Shahibaug police station.  
(M) Late after the departure of Shri M. K. Tandon, Shri P. B. Gondia, 
ACP Shr i M. T. Rana and PI Shri K. K. Mysorevala from Naroda Patiya 
area, a major incident of rioting took place between 1800 hrs and 1830 
hrs there in which 85 persons were killed and 13 persons went missing. 
Five VHP activists were named as accused in the FIR.  
(N)  Shri M. K. Tandon was in touch with certain accused persons of 
Naroda Patiya l/Naroda Gaam cases. He had received 2 telephone calls on 
01.03.2002 at 1137 hrs for 250 seconds and 1256 hrs for 161 seconds 
from accused in Naroda Patiya case Jaydeep Patel of VHP and 2 calls on 
01.03.2002 at 1458 hrs for 32 seconds and 1904 hrs for 61 seconds from 
accused Dr. Mayaben Kolnani.  
(O) Shri P. B. Gondia was also in touch with some accused persons of 
Naroda Patiya/Naroda Gaam cases. He had received 3 calls on his M obile 
phone from Dr. Mayaben Kolnani on 28.02.2002, 01.03.2002 and 408  
 
02.03.2002 at 1039 hrs , 1339 hrs and 1249 hrs respectively. He had also 
received 3 calls on 28.02.2002 at 1140 hrs, 1152 hrs and 1220 hrs,  2 
calls on 01.03.2002 at 1004 hrs and 1135 hrs an d 2 calls on 02.03.2002 
at 1156 hrs and 1848 hrs from accused Shri Jaydeep Patel.  
 
Role of Shri M.K . Tondon:  
During further investigation efforts were made to ascertain whether 
Shri M.K. Tandon could be part of the conspiracy of these offences. 
However, no evidence has come on record to establish that he was a party 
to criminal conspiracy hatched by the rioters. Normally conspiracy is 
hatched secretly and only circumstantial evidence is available to establish 
the same. In case of Shri Tandon, certain actions on his part suggest his 
bonafide intentions to control the riots. Initially he visited Gulberg society 
and lobbed tear gas shells and dispersed the mob. Subsequently he 
proceeded to Naroda Patiya and on his advice curfew was imposed in 
Naroda  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 447 
 
Patiya area by t he Commissioner of Police, Further, from Naroda Patiya 
area, he went to Dariapur which was communally very sensitive.  
As far as telephonic contact with accused persons namely, Dr. 
Mayaben Kodnani and Shri Jaydeep Patel is concerned, it has come to 
light that Dr. Kodnani was MLA from Naroda constituency and Shri 
Jaydeep Patel was Joint General Secretary, VHP, Ahmedabad Unit. These 
individuals were interrogated but they expressed inability to recollect the 
conversations and claimed that the same must be about the prevailing 
law and order situation. As regards the telephone calls made a day after 
the offence, from certain local leaders who were later prosecuted in the 
offence by itself does not make an individual a part of the conspiracy 
unless the cont ents of the conversation are known. In view of this. it 
would not be appropriate to conclude just on the basis of telephone calls 
that he was part of the conspiracy.  
Investigation has revealed that Shri Tandon got the mob dispersed 
outside Gulberg Society around 1130 hrs. However, he did not take any 
step to strengthen the hands of Shri K.G. Erda, Sr. Pl by providing him 
409  
 
some additional force as requested by the latter despite the fact that he 
had assured late Ahesan Jafri and others.  
Investigation has rev ealed that 1 platoon of S RP was allotted to DCP 
Zone -IV and that had reported at Naroda Patiya at about 1245 hrs and 
was deployed there. As cremation of 12 Karsevaks who had died on 
previous day in Godhra train incident was also to take place in 
Hatkeshwar  cremation ground, which was also in the jurisdiction of Shri  
M.K. Tandon, he had some justification to leave Naroda Patiya for 
communally hyper sensitive areas in his jurisdiction. Furthermore, DCP 
Shri P. B. Gondia, along with ACP M T Rana, were already there at Naroda 
Patiya for handling the situation.  
Investigation revealed that Dariapur was traditionally 
communally hyper sensitive. On the day between 1215 hrs and 2100 
hrs, one person had been killed in police firing and one Masjid was 
heady damaged, be sides setting of Lunsawad police post on fire by 
miscreants. However, records of that period do not reveal any action 
taken by Shri M. K. Tandon at any of the locations in Dariapur. 
Further, there is no mention of any firing done at any of the places 
under  his orders. The objective assessment of the situation reveals 
that Shri Tandon did not appreciate the circumstances 
professionally and acted in a negligent manner by not taking any 
appropriate action about the grave situation at Gulberg 
Society/Naroda Pat iya area. It would not be out if place to mention 
here that Shri M.K. Tandon was very well aware about the situation 
at Gulberg Society in as much as he had sent a message to the Police 
Control Room at 1405 hrs on 28.02.2002, that late Ahesan Jafri and 
oth ers had been surrounded by a mob and were required to be shifted 
immediately. Despite the fact that he was well aware of the 
inflammatory situation at Gulberg society, yet he chose not to go 
there. However, it is pitiable to note that he sent a message at 1545 
hrs asking there was any loss of life at Gulberg society and if so, a 
detailed report should be given to him. As Joint Commissioner of 
Police, he was expected to monitor and keep a track of developments 
throughout his jurisdiction especially when he h ad left the locations 
at Gulberg Society and Naroda Patiya which were by no means 
peaceful at that time. He left the locations at the mercy of concerned 
PI (in the case of Gulberg Society) and DCP (in the case of Naroda 
Patiya) and did not bother to inquir e/take corrective actions though, 
he had come to know of the gravity of the situations . 
 410  
 
Role of Shri P. B. Gondia  
Investigation revealed that Shri P. B. Gondia had received 3 calls on 
his Mobile phone from Dr. Mayabern Kodnani on 28.02.2002, 01.03.2002 
and 02.03.2002 at 1039 hrs, 1339 hrs and 1249 hrs respectively. He had 
also received 3 calls on 28.02.2002 at 1140 hr s, 11.52 hrs and 1220 hrs, 
2 cal!s on 01.03.2002 at 1004 hrs and 1135 hrs and 2 calls on 02.03.2002 
at 1156 hirs and 1848 hrs, from accused Shri Jaydeep Patel. Dr. Mayaben 
Kodnani, Shri Jaydeep Patel and Shri P. B. Gondia have taken the plea 
that they were  unable to recall the exact contents of these phone calls and 
claimed that these must be in connection with law and order situation. 
Notably, all these calls were incoming as far as Shri P. B. Gondia is 
concerned. As Dr. Kodnani was the local MLA and Shri Jaydeep Patel, a 
local leader, the reason given by them is probable. Shri Gondia claimed 
that 7 rioters had been killed as a result of police firing ordered by him. 
Police records show that 110 rounds of bullets and 183 teargas shells 
were fired by the pol ice personnel under him on 28.02.2002 though it did 
not show any firing resorted to personally. Furthermore, from Naroda 
Patiya he went towards Pithadiya Bambha from where some incidents of 
rioting  
 
-------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------  
Page: 448 
 
had been reported. In any case, he was instrumental in controlling a riot 
situation at Moti Manor Hotel and Rosary School on the way.  
Investigation has further revealed that he had left Naroda Patiya at 
1420 h rs despite the fact that a huge of mob of Hindu and Muslim rioters 
had gathered there while the curfew was in force. His leaving the location 
for Pithaliya Bambha was totally unjustified, especially when there was 
no information of any situation being grav er there than at Naroda Patiya. 
In case, Shri Gondia realized that he was in a position to leave the 
location, then he should have gone to Gulberg Society and not to Pithaliya 
Bambha. Shri Tandon has stated that on receipt of a message from Shri 
K.G. Erda at 1445 hrs that the Gulberg society had been surrounded by 
a mob and was about the set fire to the same, he had directed Shri PB. 
Gondia to reach Gulberg society immediately. Though this fact has been 
mentioned by Shri M K. Tandon in his affidavit filed b efore the Nanavati 
Commission in July, 2002, yet he has not been able to explain as to how 
this direction was given to Shri Gondia as there is no Control Room 
411  
 
message or mobile phone call to Shri Gondia at this point of time. 
However, Shri Gondia has denie d having received any such instructions 
from Shri Tandon.  
As indicated earlier, sufficient evidence has not come on record 
regarding police involvement of these two police officers in the 
conspiracy/abetment of the offences. However, they demonstrated 
prof ound lack of judgment that seriously undermined their credibility and 
damaged their effectiveness in dealing with the situations. All the three 
major incidents took place in area under their control and they left the 
locations for handling by the junior of ficers. They did not take any 
preventive action on 27.02 .2002, while any police officer worth the name 
could imagine the seriousness of the situation.  
Ld. Amicus Curiae has recommended prosecution of aforesaid two 
officers u/s 304A IPC. In view of this rec ommendation, available evidence 
was analysed to assess whether the inaction on the part of these two 
officers, was of the nature of Criminal negligence or professional 
misconduct.  
The basic requirements for prosecution under the above section are 
that the acts (including omission) must be rash or negligent. Here the 
issue is whether the acts of Shri M.K.Tandon and Shri P.B. Gondia would 
amount to criminal negligence justifying their prosecution. Their actions 
need to be seen and analysed in the proper persp ective and situation 
prevalent on that day. The following actions would analyse the role played 
by Shri M.K. Tandon.  
a. In the morning of 28.02.2002 he had left for Dariyapur Police 
Station (communally hyper -sensitive). On the way at 1035 hrs, he had 
heard  a wireless message of ACP 'G' Division requesting control to send 
more vehicles to Naroda Patiya. In view of this message, he proceeded 
towards Naroda Patiya. En -route he asked location of Senior Police 
Inspector of Meghaninagar Police Station and after h aving learnt that he 
was at Gulberg Society, he proceeded there and reached Gulberg Society 
at about 1130 hrs. At that time, a mob of around  1000 Hindu rioters had 
gathered there. Shri Tandon had ordered bursting of tear gas shells and 
lathi charge throug h his striking force. As a result of this action, the mob 
was dispersed in the lanes and by -lanes near Gulberg Society . 
b. Around 1200 hrs. Shri Tandon left for Naroda Patiya. At 1220 hrs 
he had made a phone call to Commissioner of Police and requested for  
imposition of curfew in Naroda Patiya. Curfew was imposed in Naroda 
Patiya area at 1230 hrs.  412  
 
c. He had informed Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City 
regarding the situation at Naroda Pariya through a phone call at 1237 
hrs. He also informed CP regarding  the funeral procession of Kar -sevaks. 
The Commissioner of Police instructed him to go to Dariapur, as the 
Dariapur Police Station is communally hypersensitive. As ACP of 
Dariapur was on leave and presence of senior officer was required there, 
he had left for Dariapur. Therefore, his leaving the spot for a known 
communally hyper -sensitive place does not amount to criminal negligence 
though it could be an error of judgment/ poor appreciation of the 
situation.  
d. During the investigation of offence at Naroda Patiya, it has been 
established that the incident took place after 1800 hrs. When Shri Tandon 
left Naroda Patiya around 1240 hrs, then Senior Police Inspector of 
Naroda Police Station along with his force, ACO ‘G' Division along with his 
force, DCP Zone IV and his striking force and one platoon of State Reserve 
Police were  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 449 
 
present there. Therefore, it was not possible to envisage that such an 
incident might take place at Naroda Patiya.  
e. Shri M.K Tandon has stated that first wireless message regarding 
the situation at Gulberg, Society was received at 1414 hrs on his wireless 
handset. He has further stated that he had not received the messages 
passed by Senior Police Inspector of Megharinagar P.S. at 1225 hrs and 
1238 hrs as the situation was very noisy in Naroda Patiya area and he 
was using public address system of his vehicle for declaration of curfew 
and ordering the mob to get dispersed.  
f. Regarding the situation at Gulberg Society, Shri M.K. Tandon has 
stated that he was informed by an unknown Muslim individual that late 
Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP and other Muslims of Gulberg Society need to be 
shifted immediately. However, his enquiries with Cont rol Room revealed 
that additional force of two DySsP, one inspector and one section of CISF 
had been sent to Gulberg Society, as per orders of Commissioner of Police.  
g. Shri M.K. Tandon has claimed that he had called Commissioner of 
Police on his mobile p hone at 1425 hrs and discussed the situation. As 
per his statement, taking the communal sensitivity of Dariapur in 
413  
 
consideration, leaving Dariapur without any senior police officer could 
have lead to drastic consequences as ACP was on leave and DCP was bus y 
in handling the law & order situation elsewhere.  
Following actions by Shri P.B.Gondia are relevant to decide as 
to whether he was liable for criminal negligence :- 
a. As per call details of mobile phone of Shri P.B.Gondia for 
28.02.2002, he was in Dariap ur Police Station area (which is communally 
hypersensitive) since 0830 hrs. Further, on receipt of an information 
regarding trouble at Naroda Patiya/ Narode Gaam, he had reached there 
around 1100 hrs. He was allotted one platoon of State Reserve Police, 
which he had deployed at Naroda Patiya and Naroda Gaam. Curfew was 
imposed at Naroda Patiya at 1230 hrs.  
b. He had ordered police firing at Naroda Patiya which had resulted in 
death of one Hindu and one Muslim rioter. Shri P.B. Gondia had left 
Naroda Patiya at 1420 hrs on receiving message regarding trouble at 
Pitadiya Bamba in Dariapur. Pitadiya Bamba had a history of serious 
communal violence in the past.  
c. At 1516 hrs, he had received instructions from Commissioner of 
Police, Ahmedabad City to go to Gulbe rg Society where he reached around 
1600 hrs and took measures to disperse the mob and rescue the 
survivors.  
d. During the investigation of the case, it has been established that the 
incident at Naroda Patiya, in which major loss of lives took place occurre d 
after 1800 hrs, i.e., approximately four hours after Shri Gondia had left 
the spot. In any case, the killings had taken place at a corner location in 
the lane which was away from the main road where police personnel were 
stationed and handling the mobs b elonging to the two communities. In 
view of this, there does not appear to be any direct nexus of these killings 
with Shri P.B. Gondia, who had left the spot at about 1420 hrs.  
e. On 28.02.2002, he had ordered firing of 110 rounds of bullets and 
183 tear g as shells to disperse the rioters at different locations which lead 
to killing of 7 rioters (including 6 Hindus).  
Section 304A means an act which is the immediate cause of death 
and not an act or omission which can be said to be a remote cause of 
death. It  is necessary to show an immediate nexus between the wrongful 
act of an accused and the injuries received by another . In order to 
constitute the offence, the death should have been the direct result of a 
rash and negligent act that must be proximate cause without intervention 414  
 
of any third factor. Furthermore, in case of criminal negligence, it must 
be gross and not which i s merely an error of judgment or arises because 
of defect of intelligence.  
Therefore, considering all the circumstances, evidence on 
record and the defence available with the suspect police officers 
namely Shri M.K.Tandon and Shri P.S. Gondia, it may not be viable 
to prosecute them for the offence u/s 304 -A IPC as proposed by Ld. 
Amicus Curiae. It is worth mentioning here that inspite of best 
efforts, no additional evidence (other than already  
 
------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------  
Page: 450 
 
available) which could help in fixing, criminal liability u/s 304A IPC 
of these two individuals could be brought on record during further 
investigation However, the conduct of Shri M. K. Tandon, the then 
Joint CP. A hmedabad City (since retired) and Shri P. B. Gondia, the 
then D CP, Ahmedabad City was unprofessional and unbecoming of 
senior police officers.  
 
Observation made by Ld. Amicus Curiae:  
The SIT may examine the role of the Investigating Agency in the 
Bilkis Bano rape case and make recommendations to this Hon'ble 
Court, whether it reveals commission of any criminal offence or 
misconduct.  
 
Result of Further Investigation:  
The  Bilkis Bano rape case  has investigated by the CBl under 
the orders of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. The case has ended it 
conviction of 12 accused persons and acquittal of 8 accused persons. 
The appeals against conviction are now pending in the High Court. 
CBI had already re commended Regular Departmental Action for 
major penalty against five police officers for the lapses on their part . 
 
Observation made by Ld. Amicus Curiae:  
415  
 
The SIT may be directed to look into the role of the Crime Branch 
officers, namely DCP Vanzara and AC P Chudasama as to their role 
in the investigation of Gulberg Society and Naroda Patiya cases.  
 
Result of Further Investigation:  
Departmental action has been recommended against Shri S.S. 
Chudasma, the then ACP, Crime Branch (since Retd.). The role played 
by Shri D.G. Vanzara, the then DCP, Crime Branch (now under 
suspension), who is in judicial custody in "Sohrabuddin fake 
encounter case"  since 2007 has been re -examined with a view to 
ascertain the lapses, on his part. However, no fresh material has 
come on  record to establish the same .  
 
Observation made by Ld. Amicus Curiae:  
The SIT may examine the role of the prosecuting agency in Best 
Bakery case and recommend suitable action against those who are 
responsible.  
 
Result of Further Investigation:  
The Best Bakery case was investigated by the Gujarat Police and 
the same ended in acquittal of all the accused persons in a trial 
conducted at Baroda in Gujarat. However, subsequently the case was 
remanded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Ind ia for a retrial under 
the jurisdiction of Bombay High Court and the same ended in the 
conviction of 9 accused persons and the acquittal of 8 accused 
persons . 
 
Observation made by bd. Amicus Curiae:  
SIT may look into the role of police officials in the Gul berg Society 
and Naroda Patiya cases (apart from those who are already facing 
charges).  
 
Result of Further Investigation:  416  
 
Govt of Gujarat would be requested to initiate appropriate action 
against the concerned officials for various administrative lapses on  their 
part.  
 
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN RELATION TO GOVT. OF 
GUJARAT : 
Observations made by Ld. Amicus Curiae:  
Departmental action, as suggested by the SIT, be taken against K. 
Kumaraswamy, the then Jt.CP, Baroda City and Ramjibhai Pargi, 
former ACP.  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 451 
 
As recommended by the SIT, departmental action be taken against 
Shri Tarun Barot, Inspector and Shri G.L. Singhal, ACP, Crime 
Branch for faulty investigat ion of the riots cases . 
 
Result of Further Investigation : 
As discussed above the recommendations made by the Ld. 
Amicus Curiae, have been agreed upon and further necessary action 
in the matter is being recommended to the Govt. of Gujarat.  
The recommendations made in Chart ‘C’ by the Ld. Amicus 
Curiae vis -a-vis comments of SIT are given below :-

ALLEGATIONS  FINDING OF SIT  OBSERVATIONS 
MADE BY AMICUS 
CURIAE  
II. Alleged decision of 
the CM to transport 
dead bodies from 
Godhra to Ahmedabad 
with a view to parade 
them  The allegation is not 
established.  
 The findings of the SIT 
appear to be justified  
 
417  
 
III. It is alleged by Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar that 
there were a number 
of verbal instructions 
given by Chief 
Minister, which were 
illegal.  
 The SIT had stated 
that there is doubt 
about the  genuineness 
of the entries in view of 
the fact that this 
register was revealed 
for the first time in 
2005 {after the 
supersession of Shri 
Sreekumar by the 
Govt.} and there is 
further no 
corroboration of th e 
statements made by 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar 
from any other source  
 It may not be 
possible to prove the 
so called illegal 
instructions in 
absence of any other 
material, except the 
statement6s of Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar 
himself. Hence, 
though the finding of 
the SIT  be accepted, 
it may not be 
appropriate to say 
that the register is 
motivated.  
 
VI. The allegation is 
regarding transfer of 6 
police officers by 
Hon’ble Chief Minister 
during the thick of 
riots to facilitate 
placement of pliable 
officers.  
 The finding of the SIT 
is that this allegation 
could not be proved.  
 We may accept SIT’s 
recommendations. 
There are 3 instances 
which are far too 
remote to lead to any 
conclusion.  
VIII.   The allegation is 
that no follow up 
action was taken up 
by the Gujarat Govt. 
on the reports sent by 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar  The finding of the 
State Govt. relating to 
the concerned subject 
had not been 
produced, and 
therefore, it is not 
clear how the Govt. 
deal with the letters of 
Shri R.B. Sreekumar.  
The SIT further 
observes that from the 
evidence of witnesses, 
it is incorrect to say 
that the letter of Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar were The findings of the 
SIT may be correct.  
The l etters of Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar were 
written after the 
riots had got over.  
Secondly, the 
contents of these 
letters appear to be 
of general nature.  
The subsequent 
developments have 
supported the 
findings of the SIT 
that some action was 
taken by the Govt. 418  
 
not acted upon by the 
Govt.  Hence, we may 
accept SIT’s 
recommendation.  
XIII.   The allegation is 
that Shri Narendra 
Modi did not give a 
direction declaring as 
Bandh called by VHP 
on 28 -02-2002 illegal  The SIT has found that 
the Bandh was not 
declared illegal by the 
Govt. of Gujarat and  
hence the allegation is 
proved  This issue is not 
having very material 
bearing.  Nothing 
would turn upon the 
fact whether the 
Bandh was declared 
illegal or not.  
XV.   The allegation is 
that there was undue 
delay in deployment of 
Army  
 
 
-------------------- ---------  
Page: 452 
 
 The SIT has come to a 
conclusion that there 
was no undue delay in 
deployment  
 
 
 
 
 
of the Army  The factual records 
are the matter of 
investigation and if 
the records are 
correct, than  
 
 
 
 
the SIT finding may 
also be correct.  
XVI.  The allegation is 
that police officials 
were not transferred 
until the arrival of Shri 
KPS Gill  The SIT has found this 
allegation is not 
correct.  The finding of the 
SIT may be accepted.  
XVII.   The allegation is 
that no action was 
taken against media or 
publishing 
communally inciting 
reports  The SIT has found that 
the allegation is true  Action should have 
been taken agains t 
the Media, but due to 
lapse of more than 8 
years, it is not 
advisable to pursue 
this matter any 
further  
XVIII.   This allegation 
relates to misleading 
reports submitted by 
the State Home 
Department regarding 
normalcy in the State 
so as to persuade the The SIT concluded 
that the allegation is 
not conclusively 
established in view of 
the fact that the 
elections were 
subsequently held 
within 3 -4 months in This issue may not  
survive any further 
and it would not 
serve any purpose to 
examine this issue in 
detail.  Hence, it is 
recommended that 
419  
 
Election Commission 
to hold early elections.  December, 2002 and 
passed off peacefully.  this issue be 
dropped.  
XIX & XX.   That Shri 
G.C. Murmu, Home 
Secretary was deputed 
to tutor the witnesses 
who were to depose 
before Nanavati 
Commission  The SIT has found this 
allegation is not 
established as the 
version given by Shri 
R.B. Sreekumar is 
motivated and cannot 
be relied upon  The allegation is 
found not proved by 
SIT, which 
recommendation be 
accepted.  It may not 
be justified to say 
that the ver5sion of 
Shri Sreekumar is 
motivated.  
XXIV.   Allegation is 
that the Gujarat Govt. 
did not provide 
conducive atmosphere 
for rehabilitat ion of 
riot victims.  The SIT has found this 
allegation is not 
correct as it is believes 
that the Govt. did 
everything for 
rehabilitation  The conclusion may 
be accepted  
XXVI .  This allegation 
relates to non -
preparation of 
minutes of meeting.  SIT has found that in 
Gujarat Govt. no 
minutes of meeting are 
prepared in case of law 
& order review meets.  Since the minutes of 
the meeting have not 
been prepared, 
nothing would come 
out in further 
investigation.  In any 
event, the minutes of 
the meeting would 
never be  prepared to 
implicate any 
Minister/official 
directly or indirectly.  
Therefore, this issue 
can be closed.  
XXXVII .  This 
allegation relates to 
not taking action 
against officers for 
filing incorrect 
affidavits before the 
Nanavati Commission  SIT has concluded 
that this matter has to 
be dealt with by the 
Nanavati Commission 
which has still to 
submit its report.  The view taken by 
the SIT appears to be 
correct.  
XXVIII.   It is alleged 
that the review of post 
trial cases was slack 
and the officers acted SIT has held that this 
allegation is not 
established.  The 
recommendations of 
the SIT be accepted.  420  
 
according to the 
political interests of 
BJP and the CM.  
XXIX .  The allegation 
is regarding nepotism 
in posting, transfer 
etc.  SIT has found that 
this allegati on is very 
vague and general and 
it is not possible to 
conduct any inquiry in 
the said allegation.  The finding of the 
SIT seems to be 
correct and may be 
accepted.  
XXX . That only 
Muslims were victims 
of riots and police 
firing due to 
collaboration between 
rioters and the 
administration.  SIT has found that 
this allegation is not 
substantiated.  This aspect may get 
covered if the 
request for further 
investigation is 
accepted by this 
Hon’ble Court.  
XXXI.   It is alleged that 
there  
 
------ -----------------------  
Page: 453 
 
was a secret meeting 
in Lunawada where 50 
top people allegedly 
met and made out a 
plan for rioting and 
use of violence.  The SIT has examined 
this  
 
 
 
 
issue in detail and 
found that the 
information was a 
figment of imagination 
of some interested 
elements, based on 
rumors and therefore, 
not established.  The view taken by 
the SIT be  
 
 
 
 
accepted.  
XXXVII .  It is alleged 
that on 28 -02-2002, 
5000 Bajrang Dal 
activists met at village 
Borvai in which attack 
on minorities was 
planned.  SIT has conducted 
investigation in detail 
and found that this is 
a cooked up story and 
the information given 
by Shri Mahboob 
Rasool was not 
correct.  The view taken by 
the SIT may be 
accepted.  
 
It may thus be seen that the Ld. Amicu s Curiae has agreed with 
the fundings of SIT in respect of Allegations No. II, III, VI, VIII, XIV, 
421  
 
XVI, XIX, XX, XXIV, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXXI & XXXII and has 
recommended to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that the 
recommendation of SIT may be accepte d in respect of these 
allegations. Further, as regards Allegations No. XIII, XVII, XVIII & 
XXVI the Ld. Amicus Curiae is of the view that the issued were not 
very material and, therefore, recommended the same to be dropped. 
However, as regard the Allegatio n No. XXX, the Ld Amicus Curiae 
opined that the allegation would get covered in the case the request 
for further investigation was accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 
of India. The Ld. Amicus Curiae has also opined that the further 
investigation conducte d by the SIT u/s 173(8) Cr.PC about the 
involvement of Shri Gordhan Zadafia has revealed that there is lack 
of evidence to suggest his involvement in the riots and that this 
findings of the SIT appears to be acceptable.  
As ordered by the Hon'ble Supreme Co urt of India, the matter 
was listed for hearing on 05.05.2011, when the following order was 
passed: - 
“Pursuant to our order dated 15th March, 2011, the 
Chairman, Special Investigation Team (SIT) has filed 
report on the further investigations carried out by  his 
team along with his remarks thereon. Statements 
ofwitnesses as also, the documents have been placed 
on record, in separate volumes. Let a copy of all these 
documents along with the report of the Chairman be 
supplied to Mrs. Raju Ramchandran, the Learn ed 
Amicus Curiae.  
The learned Amicus Curie shall examine the report, 
analyse and have his own independent assessment of 
the statements of the witnesses recorded by the SIT 
and submit his comments thereon. It will be open to 
the learned Amicus Curiae to int eract with any of the 
witnesses, who have been examined by the SIT, 
including the police officers. as he may deem fit.  
If the learned Amicus Curie forms an opinion that on 
the basis of the material on record, any offence is 
made out  against any person, he shall mention the 
same in his report.  
List on 28th July, 2011 at 3:00 p.m. ” 
 422  
 
Pursuant to the aforesaid order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme 
court of India the Ld. Amicus Curie submitted his report dated 
25.07.2011. In his report, Ld. Amicus Curiae agreed with the findings 
of the SIT on the following issues and opined that the same are 
acceptable: - 
I. That though he had observed in his note dated 20.01 .2011 that 
late Haren Pandya, the then MoS for Revenue could have been 
present in the meetin g on 27.02.2002, yet considering the 
material gathered by the SIT and that further investigation 
report of the SIT, he agrees with the SIT that late Haren Pandya 
could not have been present in the meeting on 27.02.2002 and 
therefore, his (late Haren Pandya ) statement regarding the 
alleged statement made by Shri Modi in the aforesaid meeting 
may be disregarded.  
II. That he would also agree with the findings of SIT that the 
statement made by Shri R.B. Sréekumar, the then Addl. DG 
(Int.) to Shri K. Chakravarth i, the then DGP would be  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 454 
 
hearsay evidence not saved by res gestae  and therefore, would 
be inadmissible in evidence . 
III That as far as SIT's conclusion with regard to the steps taken 
by Shri Narendra Modi to control the riots in Ahmedabad City 
is concerned, the same may be accepted.  
IV. That as far as the observations of the Chairman, SIT on the 
handing over of the bodies of the Godhra victims to Shri 
Jaydeep Patel are concerned, the same may be accepted.  
V. That as far as the observations of the SIT with regard to the 
Chief Minister's statement on television on 01.03.2002 are 
concerned the same may be accepted.  
VI. That as far as SIT's observa tions with regard to the alleged 
inaction of Shri P.C. Pande, the then Commissioner of Police, 
Ahmedabad City are concerned, no comment is necessary at 
this stage as an application u/s 319 Cr.PC, has been filed in 
respect of Shri P.C. Pande also, and the s ane may be dealt with 
423  
 
by the concerned Court in accordance with law, in the same 
manner as suggested in respect of Shri M.K. Tandon and Shri 
P.B Gondia.  
 
Shri Raju Ramchandran, Amicus Curiae has come to the 
conclusion that at this prima facie stage offenc es inter -alia u/s 153 
A(1)(a) & (b), 153B(1) (c),166 and 505(2) IPC are made out against Shri 
Narendra Modi. He has further stated that it would be for the Court 
of competent jurisdiction to decide whether Shri Modi has to be 
summoned for any or all of the se offences or for any other offences. 
These findings are based on the following grounds  :- 
a. That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has brought his former driver Shri 
Tarachand  Yadav and had submitted his affidavit sworn on 
17.06.2011, which supports Shri Bhatt's version that he had 
gone to the residence of the Chief Minister on 27.02.2002.  
b. That Shri Sanjiv Bhatt submitted an affidavit of Shri  K.D. 
Panth, Constable affirmed on 17.6.2011 supporting the 
version of Shri Bhatt about going to Chief Minister's residence 
on the night of 27.02.2002.  
c. That Shri Rahul Sharma, DIG submitted an analysis of the call 
records of senior police officers, which according to Shri 
Sharma corroborates the statement of Shri Bhatt.  
d. That though Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has been contending that he 
wou ld speak only when under a legal obligation to do so, his 
conduct after making a statement u/s 161 Cr.PC has not been 
that of a detached police officer, who is content with giving 
his version.  
e. That it does not appear very likely that a serving police offic er 
would make such a serious allegation against Shri Narendra 
Modi , Chief Minister without some basis.  
f. That there is no documentary material of any nature 
whatsoever, which can establish that Shri Bhatt was not 
present in the meeting on 27.02.2002 and in t he absence of 
the minutes of the meeting, there is again no documentary 
evidence is available, as to the participants in the meeting and 
what transpired at the said meeting. Therefore, it is the word 
of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt against the word of other officers senior 
to him . 424  
 
g. That it is difficult to accept that Shri Bhatt's statement is 
motivated because he has an axe to grind with the State Govt. 
over issues concerning his career and it may not be proper to 
disbelieve Shri Sanjiv Bhatt at this stage only because  the 
other officers have not supported his statement.  
h. That the delay in making the statement can not be the sole 
ground to disbelieve the statement at this stage especially in 
view of his explanation that as an Intelligence Officer, who was 
privy to a lot of sensitive information, he would make a 
statement only when he was under a legal obligation to do so . 
i. That Shri G.C. Raiger, Addl. DG (Int) was on leave on  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 455 
 
27.02.2002 and DGP Shri K Chakravarthi does not state that 
he had gathered intelligence from the office of Shri Raiger.  
Further, Shri P.C. Upadhay, the t hen DCI (Political & 
Communal) was on leave on 27.02.2002 and Shri Bhatt was 
looking after his work. Also Shri Raiger has stated that Shri 
Bhatt had accompanied him in the past to meetings called by 
the Chief Minister, though he used to wait out side with files 
or information and therefore, it is quite possible that Shri 
Bhatt was directed to attend the meeting on 27.02.2002 at the 
residence of Chief Minister.  
j. That the phone calls records do not contradict the statement 
given by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to the SIT  and considering the 
important and emergent nature of the meeting, the relative 
juniority of Shri Bhatt need not have come in the way of his 
attending the meeting especially since Addl. DG (Int.) Shri 
Raiger was not available and Shri O.P. Mathur, the IGP 
(Security & Admn.) who was next in seniority was not called 
for the meeting and that this aspect was of little significance 
in the context of an emergency meeting called at short notice 
in response to an escalating situation.  
k. That the discrepancies about t he exact language used or the 
time of meeting at the Chief Minister's residence at 
Gandhinagar on 28.02 .2002, are inevitable considering the 
lapse of time . 
425  
 
 
As regard the assessment of the role played by Shri M.K. 
Tandon, the then Jt. CP, Sector -II, Ahmeda bad City and Shri. 
P.B.Gondia, the then DCP, Zone -IV, Ahmedabad City, the Ld. Amicus 
Curiae has recommended that it would be appropriate for the Hon'ble 
Supreme Court of India to direct the trial Court to consider an 
application u/s 319 Cr.PC filed by the victims in Gulberg Society 
Case on the evidence brought before it and also consider the further 
investigation report submitted by Shri Himanshu Shukla, DCP to the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 26.11.2010 and the statements 
recorded by him and to pass a ppropriate orders in accordance with 
law. The Ld. Amicus Curiae has also submitted to the Hon’ble 
Supreme Court to consider whether an offence u/s 304A IPC is made 
out. The Ld. Amicus Curiae has finally come to the conclusion that 
since the SIT has conduct ed a statutory investigation u/s 173 (8) 
Cr.PC, the report is required to be filed in the Court and it is for the 
competent Court to pass necessary orders after hearing the 
concerned parties. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has 
refrained from passing an y order in this regard except that Chairman, 
SIT has been directed to forward a Final Report along with entire 
material collected by it to the Court, which had taken cognisance of 
Cr.No.67/2002 u/s 173(2) Cr.PC . 
Shri Raju Ramachandran, the Ld. Amicus Curiae has agreed 
with the findings of the SIT on all the major issues. Whereas the 
complainant has made an allegation that Shri Narendra Modi, Chief 
Minister sponsored the riots, the Ld. Amicus Curiae has come to the 
conclusion that sufficient steps were taken by the Chief Minister to 
control the riots. The Ld. Amicus Curiae did not allege any 
conspiracy or abetment on the part of Chief Minister. He has further 
agreed with the recommendations of SIT that the statement made by 
Shri R. B. Sreekumar that Shri  K. Chakravarthi had informed him 
about the utterances made by the Chief Minister on 27.02.2002 night 
would not be admissible as the same amounted to hearsay evidence 
and therefore, inadmissible. He is also of the view that the 
recommendations of the SIT a bout the steps taken by the Chief 
Minister to control the riots may be accepted. He has also agreed 
with the recommendations of chairman, SIT about handing over the 
dead bodies of Godhra victims to Shri Jaydeep Patel. About the Chief 
Minister's alleged sta tement on television on 01.03.2002, by 
referring to the Newton's third Law of Motion also the Amicus has 
agreed the recommendations of the SIT.  426  
 
 Shri Raju Ramchandran, Ld. Amicus Curiae is of the view that 
a prima facie case u/s 153 A(1)(a) & (b), 153B(1)( c), 166 and 505(2) 
IPC is made out against Shri Narenda Modi, Chief Minister. However, 
he is further of the view that it would be for the Court of competent 
jurisdiction to decide whether Shri Modi has to be summoned for any 
or all of these offences or for  any other offence. This 
recommendations of Ld. Amicus Curiae is based on the sole 
testimony of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security), who has 
claimed to have attended a meeting called by the Chief Minister on 
27.02.2002 night at his residence. It may  be mentioned here that 
seven (7) other participants of the said meeting have categorically 
stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not attend the said meeting. 
According to the Ld. Amicus Curiae, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt produced his 
driver Shri Tarachand Yadav, a dis missed constable driver of Gujarat 
Police along with his affidavit dated 17.06.2011, who supports, Shri 
Bhatt's version that he had gone to the residence of the Chief 
Minister on 27.02.2002. In this connection, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has 
stated that he had gone  along with Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then 
DGP in the latter’s staff car to CM’s residence  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 456 
 
from DGP’s office and that Shri K.D. Panth, the then AIO, Sta te IB 
followed him in his staff car driven by Shri Tarachand Yadav. The Ld. 
Amicus Curiae has wrongly projected that Shri K.D. Panth, constable 
has supported the version of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt about the latter's visit 
to CM's residence on 27.02.2002, in as m uch as Shri K.D. Panth has 
lodged a complaint on 17.06.2011 against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt for 
wrongful confinement and also for getting an affidavit signed from 
him under duress and threat and a case I CR No.149/2011 was 
registered u/s 189, 193, 195, 341, 342 IPC has been registered 
against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt on 22.06.2011 in Ghatlodia P.S, 
Ahmedabad City. Shri Raju Ramchandran has relied upon a copy of 
this affidavit which was handed over to him by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt on 
17.06.2011.  In fact, Shri K.D. Panth had sent a letter to Chairman, 
SIT in this regard on 17.06.2011 itself along with another affidavit 
sworn before the Dy. Collector, Gandhinagar to the effect that he was 
on leave on 27.02.2002, and that his statement made before the SIT 
in this regard was corr ect. It would not be out of place to mention 
427  
 
here that a copy of the said letter along with the affidavit submitted 
to SIT by Shri K.D. Panth with its English translation were handed 
over to Shri Raju Ramchandran by Shri Y.C. Modi, Member, SIT and 
Shri A.K . Malhotra, Member, SIT personally on 21.06.2011, but the 
same has been conveniently ignored by the Ld. Amicus Curiae. The 
claim of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has been dismissed by Shri K. 
Chakravarthi, the then DGP, who has denied that Shri Bhatt 
accompanied him i n his staff car to CM's residence on 27.02.2002. 
Significantly, log book of the vehicle of Shri Chakravarthi shows only 
PSO accompanied him and there is no mention of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
in the same. Further, Shri Dilip Ahir and Shri Dharampal Yadav, the 
the n PSOs to the DGP and Shri Panchusinh Yadav and Shri Mangilal 
Kala, the then drivers attached to the DGP have categorically denied 
that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt ever travelled in DGP's staff car. The 
observation made by the Ld. Amicus Curiae that Shri K.D. Panth had 
supported the version of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt is, therefore, incorrect. 
Further, keeping in view the version of Shri K.D. Panth that he was 
on leave on 27.02.2002, would falsify the statement made by Shri 
Tarachand Yadav, driver to the effect that he had followed the DGP's 
vehicle with Shri K.D.  Panth , Constable . 
It is significant to note that the Ld. Amicus Curiae has admitted 
that  
"I am conscious of the fact that though Shri Bhatt has been 
contending that he would speak only when under a legal 
obligation to do so, his conduct after making his statement u/s 
161 Cr.PC has not been that of a detached police officer, who is 
content with giving his version. I am left with no doubt that he is 
actively "strategising" and is in touch with those, who wou ld 
benefit or gain mileage from his testimony":  
The Ld. Amicus Curiae has also mentioned that Shri Rahul 
Sharma, DIG submitted an analysis of the call records of senior police 
officers, which according to Shri Sharma corroborates the statement 
of Shri Bhat t. Shri Rahul Sharma never stated anything like that 
before the SIT Shri Rahul Sharma has not stated that in what manner 
the call details of the senior officers corroborate the statement of 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt. The Ld. Amicus Curiae has accepted the 
contenti on of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt that as an Intelligence Officer, he 
was privy to some information and would speak only, when he was 
legally bound to do so. In this connection it may be stated that the 
alleged meeting called by the Chief Minister in the night of 428  
 
27.02.2002 was essentially a law and order review meeting which was 
attended by the various officials of State Administration and 
therefore the question of oath of secrecy or application of the Official 
Secrets Act does not arise because it was neither a sec ret meeting 
nor would the revelation of the contents of the said meeting 
jeopardized the public interest. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt has used the 
Official Secrets Act as a pretext to justify a long delay of nine years 
and the fact that an official of the intelligen ce unit attended a law & 
order meeting, the same does not became a secret meeting for which 
a privilege of secrecy is being claimed by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt. The view 
of the Ld. Amicus Curiae that it does not appear very likely that a 
serving police officer wo uld make such a serious allegation without 
some basis appears to be erroneous in as much as Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
had been all along a delinquent in his career and had been trying to 
bargain with the government. The very fact that three departmental 
enquiries against Shri Sanjiv Bhatt were dropped in 2006 -07 and he 
was given three promotions on a single day would by itself go to show 
his service career progression. Again his promotion to the rank of 
IGP was due for quite sometime but he did not get the same bec ause 
of other departmental enquiries as well as court cases pending 
against him. This reason by itself is sufficient to bring a motive on 
the part of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to make a statement against the Chief 
Minister. Further, it is true that no minutes of t he meeting were 
maintained and there is no documentary evidence available to show 
as to what transpired in the said meeting. However, the evidence of 
seven senior officers can not be ignored to the effect that Shri Sanjiv 
Blatt was not present in the said meeting and claim of Shri Sanjiv  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 457 
 
Bhatt about his having attended the said meeting and also about 
some alleged utterances made by the Chief Minister is n ot 
acceptable. The observation made by the Ld. Amicus Curiae that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt can not be disbelieved because his statements was 
motivated and he has an axe to grind against the government over 
issues concerning his career and also that absurd. The fu rther 
observation of Ld. Amicus Curiae that in the absence of Shri G.C. 
Raiger, the then Addl. DGP (INT) and Shri P.B. Upadhya, the then DCI 
(Political & Communal) being on leave, it was quite possible that Shri 
429  
 
Sanjiv Bhatt was directed to attend the meet ing on 27.02.2002 is 
based on conjectures and surmises. The contention of Ld. Amicus 
Curiae that the phone call records do not contradict the statement 
of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt is without any basis in as much as the same do 
not even support his statement. The call detail records show the 
location of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt at Ahmedabad and the last call was 
received by him at 20.40 hours, which do not establish that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt had gone to Gandhinagar to attend a meeting around 
22:30 hours . 
Significantly, the c laim of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt of having attended 
the meetings on 27/28.02.2002 becomes false and unacceptable as 
according to his call detail records he could not have been present 
in the alleged meeting that took place at CM's residence on 
28.02.2002 at 1030 hrs. Another claim of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt that he 
left the meeting of 27.02.2002 night halfway is suggestive of the fact 
that in reality he did not attend the meeting. This meeting was of a 
very short duration and it was practically impossible for a junior 
officer of the level of Shri Bhatt to leave the meeting midway.  
Further, the view of Ld. Amicus Curiae that the exact language 
allegedly used by the Chief Minister in the said meeting on 
27.02.2002 is not material, can not be accepted in as much as there 
are atleast three versions available on record in this regard. Smt. 
Jakia Nasim in her complaint has claimed that a high level meeting 
was convened by the Chief Minister at which Chief Secretary Subba 
Rao, Home Secretary Ashok Narayan and senior police men were 
summoned at which clear instructions were given 'not to deal with 
the Hindu rioting mobs'. Further, Shri R. B. Sreekumar has claimed 
that Shri K. Chakravarthi had informed him on 28.02.2002 that Shri 
Narendra Modi, CM had convened a meeting of senior officers on 
27.02.2002 late in the evening on return from Godhra and had said 
that in communal riots police takes action against Hindus and 
Muslims on one to one basis. This will not do now – allow Hindus to 
give vent to their anger. As against this, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt claims 
that the Chief Minister allegedly impressed upon the gathering in the 
meeting for that for too long the Gujarat Police had been following 
the principle of balancing the actions against the Hindus and 
Muslims while dealing with the commu nal riots in Gujarat. This time 
the situation warranted that the Muslims be -taught a lesson to 
ensure that such incidents do not recur ever again. The Chief 
Minister Shri Narendra Modi expressed the view that the emotions 
were running very high amongst the  Hindus and it was imperative 430  
 
that they be allowed to vent out their anger. It is not understood as 
to whose words should be relied upon because none of them i.e. Smt . 
Jakia Nasim, Shri R. B. Sreekumar and Shri Sanjiv Bhatt were 
present in the said meeting . Another factor worth consideration at 
this stage is that there is no evidence available on record that any 
instructions on these lines were passed on to the police formation 
down below thereby ruling out the possibility of such utterances as 
alleged were  made by CM in the meeting.   
Based on the aforesaid three versions Amicus Curiae has arrived at 
a conclusion that the same would attract the offences u/s I53 A (1) (a) & 
(b), 153B (1) (c),166 and 505 (2) IPC.  
Section 153A (1) (a) IPC states that 'whoever, by words promotes 
or attempts to promote disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred, or 
ill will on the ground of religion between different religious 
communities. In other words, Section 153A(1)(b) IPC can be 
paraphrased as 'whoever commits any ac t which is prejudicial to the 
maintenance of harmony between different religious communities 
and which is likely to disturb the public tranquility’. Even if any of 
the aforesaid three versions allegedly made by Chief Minister, the 
ingredients of section 15 3A(1) (a) & (b) are not attracted. The facets 
of the allegations attributed to Shri Narendra Modi can not fall under 
sub -class (a) or (b) of the 153 (A) (1) IPC. At this juncture, it would 
not be out of place to mention that the Chief Minster made four 
statements within 24 hours on 27/28.02.2002. At Godhra on 
27.02.2002 evening the Chief Minister publicly said that burning of 
karsevaks in a train at Godhra was unparalleled in the history and 
assured the people that the culprits would be punished. He also sa id 
that the Government would ensure that the peace was maintained in 
the State and the Government would not be lacking in discharging 
its duty. On 28.02.2002 morning, he spoke in the assembly after 
obituary reference that the State government has taken thi s cruel , 
inhuman, heinous and organized crime very seriously and is 
committed to take symbolic strict   
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 458 
 
steps and to punish the culprits in such an exempl ary manner that 
such an incident may not recur in future. On 28.02.2002 afternoon 
431  
 
in his press conference in Circuit House Annexe, Ahmedabad, Shri 
Narendra Modi reiterated that Government of Gujarat has taken this 
heinous train burning incident at Godhra v ery seriously and that 
people should help the government to ensure that the culprits are 
punished. Shri Narendra Modi also told the press that those who had 
acted in retaliation and anger after the incident shall also not be 
spared. Further, he appealed  made to the people of Gujarat on 
Doordarshan on 28.02 .2002 evening to keep restrain and maintain 
peace and harmony. He also said that the Government was 
determined to bring these culprits to justice and give them 
unimaginable punishment. It may thus be seen that the thrust of 
CM's speech everywhere was that the incident was heinous, 
organised and that the culprits would be brought to strictest, 
punishment .  
Similarly, section 505 (2) IPC can be paraphrased as Whoever 
makes any statement with intend to create (or permit to create (or 
is likely to create or permit to create) feelings of enmity or hatred or 
ill will between different religious community. In view of the reasons 
enumerated above a case u/s 505(2) IPC is also not made out.  
Also, section 153B (1) (c) IPC can be paraphrased as Whoever by 
words makes any assertion concerning, the obligation of any class or 
person by reason of their being members of a religious community 
and such assertion is likely to cause disharmony or feeling of enmity 
or hatred o r ill will between such members and other persons. As 
regards the application of this section, it may be mentioned that it 
is not the case that the Chief Minister made any assertion 
concerning the obligation of any religious community to do such acts 
as ar e likely to cause disharmony. He did not make any appeal to 
Hindus or Musli ms to take up arms against each other. On the other 
hand Shri Narendra Modi made an appeal on 28.02.2002 that both 
the communities should desist from doing any act by physically 
attacking each other. This appeal was broadcasted by the 
Doordarshan intermittently. In view of this no offence u/s 153B (1) 
(c) IPC is made out.  
As regards section 166 IPC, it deals with the public servants 
disobeying any direction of law as to the way in wh ich he is to 
conduct himself as a public servant. It can not be extracted from the 
statement attributed to Shri Narendra Modi that he was thereby 
disobeying any directions of law as to the way, in which he is to 
conduct himself as Chief Minister. No such d irections can be quoted 432  
 
from law as for the Chief Minister to disobey it. In view of this there 
is no application of section 166 IPC at all against Shri Narendra Modi.   
Thus recommendations of Amicus Curiae and evidence 
collected during further investigati on u/s 173 (8) Cr.PC have been 
examined in detail to see, if the ingredients of the suggested sections 
for prosecution are attracted or not. On such assessment it is 
reasonably concluded that no utterances on part of Shri Narendra 
Modi could be attributed suggestive to any intended promotion of 
hatred ill -will etc. amongst religious groups. The settled legal 
position is that mensrea is required for offen ces u/s 153A IPC. In 
view of the same and evidence discussed in preceding paras, there is 
no evidence to prima facie allege commission of suggested offences 
by Shri Narendra Modi.  
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, DIG (under suspension) has sent a letter 
dated 30.12.2011 to the Secretary, Hon'ble Justice Nanavati & 
Justice Mehta Commission of Inquiry enclosing herewith an 
Annexure 'D', which is a copy of fax message No. D -2 /2 -COM

(Sanjiv Bhatt)  
Dy. Commissioner (Communal)  
For Add l. D. G. P. Int., G. S. 
Gandhinagar  
 
On receiving Shri Bhatt's communication dated 04.01.2012 a 
notice u/s 91 Cr.PC was issued to Shri Sanjiv Bhat on 13.01.2012, 
to produce the original /office copy of the fax message dated 
27.02.2002. However, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt refused to accept the said 
notice. Instead, he sent a letter dated 15.01.2012 contending that 
the aforesaid document had already been handed over to Shri A .K. 
Malhotra of SIT in t he year 2009 and IO Shri Himanshu  Shukla in  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 460 
 
2011. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt further contended that, in the normal course 
of investigation, the Investigating Officer should have called for the 
original and/or office copy of the aforesaid fax message from the 
State IB Gandhinagar and the offices of the respective recipients of 
the said fax message.  
In this connection, it may be emphasized that the statement of 
Shri Sanjeev Bhatt was recorded by Shri A.K. Malhotra, Member, SIT 
during Enquiry on 25.11.2009 & 26.11.2009, and the same was 
signed by Shri Bhatt. However, the same did not contain any 
reference to the aforesaid two messages, which Shri Bhat t now 
claims to have sent on 27.02.2002 & 28.02.2002, despite the fact 
435  
 
that copies of all others messages duly mentioned by him in his 
statement were handed over by Shri Bhatt to Shri Malhotra. 
Similarly, the statement of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was recorded u/s  161 
Cr.PC by the IO Shri Himanshu Shukla on 21.03.2011 & 22.03.2011, 
and the same also did not contain any reference to the aforesaid two 
messages. This raises very serious doubts about the authenticity of 
the claim that these messages had in fact been se nt to the concerned 
addresses. Significantly, the statements recorded by Shri A.K. 
Malhotra and the IO (Shri Himanshu Shukla) were submitted to the 
highest Court of country (Supreme Court) at the relevant point time.  
Apart from the aforesaid position, the  following points would go 
to show that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had the full opportunity to produce 
these messages if they had in fact been prepared and sent to 
concerned authorities, and did not produce before SIT : 
1. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not file any affidavi t before the Nanavati 
Commission of Inquiry, and, in case, he, was in possession of 
these documents, he should have filed the same as per the 
instructions given by Govt. of Gujarat in the year 2002.  
2. Shri R.B. Sreekumar, formerly Addl. DGP (Int.) in his letter 
dated 27.12.2011 addressed to Secretary, Nanavati 
Commission of Inquiry has categorically stated that he had 
requested all the senior officers of the State IB in the rank of 
SP and above including Shri Sanjiv Bhatt (who had assisted his 
predecessor Shri G.C. Raiger, Addl. DG (Int.) from 27.02.2002 
to 08.04.2002) to submit any affidavit covering the terms of 
reference of the Commission; but none of them filed any 
affidavit. Shri Sreekumar further stated in his letter to the 
Nanavati Commission that he  had asked all the senior officers 
of State IB to provide him all the relevant documents in their 
possession relating to riots. Accordingly, all these documents 
received by him from his officers were appended by him to his 
first affidavit filed before the Commission on 15.07.2002. 
However, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not produce any such message 
before Shri Sreekumar.  
3. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not produce any of the aforesaid 
messages, either before Shri  A.K.Malhotra, Member, SIT during 
the course of the prelimin ary inquiry conducted by him under 
the orders of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India or before Shri 
Himanshu Shukla, DCP,  Crime, Ahmedabad City, who had 
conducted further investigation u/s 173(8) in this case 436  
 
(Cr.No.67/2002 of Meghaninagar P.S. (Gulberg Society  Case)). 
He did not also refer to either of these two fax messages in his 
statements made before Shri A.K. Malhotra Member, SIT on 
25.11.2002 & 26.11.2002 and before Shri Himanshu Shukla on 
21.03.2011. As already highlighted above, both these 
statements we re submitted to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of 
India on 14.05.2010 and 25.04.2011 respectively.  
4. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, suo moto, filed an affidavit dated 14.04.2011 
before the Hon'ble  Supreme Court of India in SLP (Crl.) 
1088/2008 filed by Smt. Jakia Nasim. In that affidavit also he 
did not mention anything about the two aforesaid fax messages.  
5. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was summoned before the Nanavati 
Commission in May, June & July, 2011 f or his deposition and 
cross examination. However, he did not mention anything 
about the aforesaid two fax messages to the Commission.  
6. Shri Sanjiv Bhatt was called by Shri Raju Ramchandran, Amicus 
Curiae for personal interaction at Gandhinagar on 18.06. 2011. 
On that occasion also, Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not mention 
anything about the aforesaid two fax messages to the Amicus 
Curiae and confirmed his statements recorded during the SIT's 
Preliminary Inquiry  as well as subsequently recorded u/s 161 
Cr.PC by t he IO . 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 461 
 
7. Shri R.B.Sreekumar, in his letter dated 28.12.2011 addressed 
to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt (copy sent to SIT), has clearly stated that 
the plethora of incriminating information against the Govt ., 
which he (Sanjiv Bhatt) claimed to possess now, had not been 
put up to him at the time of filing his first affidavit on 15.07 
2002. Further, if it had come to his (Sanjiv Bhatt), notice that 
such mat erial had not been included in his affidavit, nothing 
stopped him from filing a separate affidavit bringing these 
relevant inputs to the notice of the Commission. Shri 
Sreekumar also highlighted that nearly 12 intelligence reports 
produced before him by Sh ri Sanjiv Bhatt were included in it, 
and the same did not contain anything about the role of the 
437  
 
Govt. officials in the alleged planning and execution of the 
antiminority genocide and subsequent prolonged subversion of 
the criminal justice system and delay ed justice to the riot 
victims . 
It may thus be seen that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt produced two fax 
messages for the first time before Nanvati Commission of Inquiry 
only in the month of December, 2011, and subsequently before the 
SIT in January, 2012.  
A perusal of  the photo copy of the office copy of fax message 
No. D -2/2 -COM / ALERT/100/2002, dated 27.02.2002 claimed to 
have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) on behalf 
of Addl. DGP (Int.) to CP, Ahmedabad with information to PS to CM, 
PS to Mo S (Home), Home Secretary and Police Gandhinagar, would 
go to show that there was no security classification of the said 
message. The dispatch register of the D -2 section of the State IB does 
not show any dispatch of the said message as the dispatch number 
on the said date was under serial number 90. Investigation revealed 
that actually a letter No. D -2 /2 -COM/BANAO/100/2002, dated 
02.03.2002 was sent on behalf of Addl. DG (Int.) to ACS (Home),  Govt. 
of Gujarat with information to Police Gandhinagar, PS to C M and PS 
to MoS(Home) and the same related to I Cr. No. 9/02 u/s 302, 114 
etc. of Khanpur P.S., Distt. Panchmahals. The said message bears a 
typed dispatch number, which is very unusual, because all the 
dispatch numbers on the messages sent by State IB on 27.02.2002 
were hand written. It is not understood as to what prompted Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt  to send such a message, when all the individuals to 
whom this message had been addressed were present in the meeting 
held at the CM's residence on the night of 27.02.2 002, and it was 
known to all of them that the Govt. had already decided to bring the 
dead bodies to Ahmedabad, for which the necessary bandobast was 
required to be made: The said message had not been marked to IGP 
(P&C), but was allegedly put up to Shri O. P. Mathur, the then IGP 
(PRC) who allegedly initialled the same in token of having seen the 
same on 28.02.2002. Surprisingly, this message was not put up to 
Shri G.C. Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.), who was very much in the 
office on 28.02.2002. Further,  Shri O.P. Mathur, the then IGP (P & C) 
also did not mark it to Addl. DG (Int.), a fact which raises serious 
doubts about the genuineness of the message in question . 
A perusal of the photo copy of the office copy of fax message 
No. D-2 /2 -COM/ALERT/174/200 2, dated 28.02.2002, now claimed 
to have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security), on 
behalf of Addl. DGP (Int.) to PS to CM and PS to MoS (Home) with 
information to Home Secretary, Police Gandhinagar and CP, 
Ahmedabad, would go to show that  there was no security 438  
 
classification of the said message. The dispatch register of the D -2 
section of the State IB also does not show any dispatch of the said 
message as the dispatch number on the said date was under serial 
number 100. Investigation revea led that O.No. D -2/2 -
Com/174/2002, dated 16.03.2002 was sent by Addl. DG (Int.) to Shri 
B.K. Haldar, Jt. Secretary (NI), MHA, New Delhi and related to the 
daily report about the communal incidents up to 16.03.2002 (1800 
hrs) in Gujarat state. This message was allegedly put up to Shri G.C. 
Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.), for favour of perusal, and the same 
allegedly bears the initials of Shri Raiger dated 28.02.2002. 
Interestingly, the message in question had been addressed to PS to 
CM and PS to MoS (Home) , whereas the same was actually actionable 
by Commissioner of Police, Ahmedabad City. Further, Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt had signed a fax message No. C/ D -2 /BANAO /178 /2002, 
dated 28.02.2002, which was received by Shri E.L. Christian, the 
then PI, State IB Contr ol Room and written by Shri Bharatsinh 
Rathod, the then A IO, to the dictation of Shri Christian, who 
subsequently took it personally to Shri Bhatt for his signature. In 
this message, it had been mentioned that, based on received 
information, Gulberg Societ y located in Chamanpura, Meghaninagar 
had been attacked by a mob of Hindu rioters and late Ahesan Jafri, 
Ex-MP along with his family members and 18 others had been killed, 
and that the attack was still continuing and this incident was likely 
to have Statew ide repercussions. This message would clearly show 
that no earlier intimation prior to the attack on Gulberg Society had 
been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, as the same did not contain any 
reference to the earlier message claimed to  
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 462 
 
have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt vide message No.D -2/2 -
COM/ALERT/174/2002 dated 28.02.2002. The information 
contained in the message No.178 dated 28.02.2002 had actually been 
received over telephone by Shri E.L. Christian, PI who had dictated 
the same to his A IO Shri Rathod and not by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt as 
claimed by him. Undoubtedly at the time of signing this message, 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt had marked t he message as "MOST URGENT" in his 
own handwriting. Efforts were made to locate the dispatch register 
and fax register of State IB Control Room, but the same had been 
reportedly destroyed. Further efforts were made to locate the so 
called message No. 174 d ated 28.02.2002 with the persons to whom

the said message had been shown addressed, but without any success 
till date.  
During the course of further investigation, the persons who are 
supposed to have received the two messages dated 27.02.2002 & 
28.02.2002 as well as the concerned officials of State IB, who were 
present in the office as also in the Control Room on the aforesaid 
two dates were examined and the evidence collected is discussed in 
subsequent paras.  
Dr. P.K. Mishra, the then Principal Secretary to Chief Minister, 
has denied having received or seen the message dated 27.02.2002, 
purportedly sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt. He is of the view that there 
was no occasion for Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to send such a message, 
because every participant at the law & ord er review meeting called 
by the Chief Minister on the night of 27.02.2002 was aware of the 
fact that the dead bodies of kar -sevaks who were killed in Godhra 
train carnage incident, were being brought to Ahmedabad by road 
under police escort. Dr. Mishra den ied receiving or having seen the 
fax message No. D -2/2 - COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 28.02.2002. 
He added that the claimed message was quite alarming, and that had 
he received any such message, he would certainly remember the 
same. On being shown fax message No.C/ D -2 / BANAO / 178/2002, 
dated 28.02.2002 handwritten in Gujarati and signed by Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt on behalf of Addl. DG (Int.) and addressed to Home Secretary, 
Gandhinagar with information to PS to CM, PS to MoS (Home) Police 
Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad  City. Dr. Mishra stated that the 
language/expression of this message clearly indicated that the 
information about the said incident was being sent for the first time, 
as there was no reference to the message No. 174, which Shri Bhatt 
now claims to have se nt earlier during that day. Finally, Dr. Mishra 
stated that the aforesaid two fax messages dated 27.02.2002 & 
28.02.2002 in English allegedly sent by Shri Bhatt were false and 
fabricated documents.  
Shri Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home), denied having 
received or seen the two typed fax messages No. D -2 /2 -COM / 
ALERT/100/2002, dated 27.02.2002 & D -2/2 -
COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 28.02.2002 in English now claimed 
to have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI. He further 
stated that both these messag es were false and bogus, and had never 
been received in his office. According to Shri Gordhan Zadafia, these 
messages have been fabricated and have been introduced for the first 
time after a lapse of about 10 years of the events mentioned therein, 
and that  this appears to be a deliberate attempt on the part of Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt to involve him in the Gulberg Society incident. He does 
not remember receiving message No. C/D -2/ BANAO/178/2002, 
dated 28.02.2002 in Gujarati bearing the signature of Shri Sanjiv 440  
 
Bhatt. However, Shri Gordhan Zadafia has stated that the fact that 
this message does not contain any reference to the earlier message 
No. 174 allegedly claimed to have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt on 
the same day, would show that the earlier message was a fabricated 
one. He has stated that he came to know about the Gulberg Society 
incident late in the afternoon of 28.02.2002, and that on receipt of 
the said information, necessary instructions were given to the 
concerned police officers to deal effectively w ith the situation . 
Shri V.P. Patel, the then Private Secretary to MoS (Home) has 
denied receiving or having seen the two typed fax messages No.D -
2/2 -COM/ALERT/100/2002, dated 27.02.2002 and D -2/2 -
COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 28.02.2002 in English claimed to 
have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI. He further stated 
that he did not remember to have received the handwritten fax 
message No. C/D -2/BANAO/178/2002, dated 28.02.2002 in Gujarati 
bearing the signature of Shri Sanjiv Bhatt.  
Shri Ashok Narayan,  the then ACS (Home), denied having 
received or seen the typed fax message No. D -2/2 -
COM/ALERT/100/2002, dated 27.02.2002 claimed to have been 
sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt.  Shri Ashok Narayan is of the view that 
such a message was not required to be sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, 
because as a decision to bring the dead bodies of the kar -sevaks to 
Ahmedabad by road had already been taken by the Chief Minister at 
Godhra itself sometime in the evening of 27.02.2002, and this fact 
was well within the knowledge of DGP  and CP,

Ahmedabad. He further denied having received or seen a typed fax 
message No.D -2 /2 -COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 28.02.2002 
purportedly sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt on behalf of Addl. DS (Int.) to 
PS to CM and PS to MoS (Home) with information to Home Secretary, 
Gandhinagar. According to Shri Ashok Narayan, the message was 
rather unusual. He added that both these fax messages are not 
genuine and are false and fabricated documents. He denied having 
received any information about the attack on Gulberg Society, and 
he came to know about the killing of late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP 
through Shri Nityanandam, the then Home Secretary some time after 
the incident.  After going through the message No.C/D -2/ 
BANAO/178/2002, dated 28.02.2002 handwritten in Gujarati . Shri 
Ashok Narayan stated that he does not remember to have received 
such a message after the incident, and has stated that the same does 
441  
 
not contain any r eference to any earlier message vide No.174 claimed 
to have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt . 
Shri K. Chakravarthi, the then DGP, Gujarat has stated that the 
fax message in English bearing No.D -2/2 -COM/ ALERT/100/2002, 
dated 27.02.2002 purportedly sent by Sh ri Sanjiv Bhatt as DCI 
(Security) was not received or seen by him on 27.02.2002 night, 
though a copy of the same is shown to have been marked to Police 
Gandhinagar. He has further stated that in all such law & order 
matters normally senior officers of Stat e IB were expected to inform 
their superior telephonically and thereafter follow it up with such 
written message. He has also stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not 
contact him telephonically or in person on the night intervening 
27/28.02.2002 in this regar d. He has denied to have received any 
intelligence report about the massive mobilization of local cadres of 
BJP for the VHP supported Gujarat Bandh. After going through a 
photo copy of another fax message bearing No. D -2/2 -COM/ 
ALERT/174/2002, dated 28.02. 2002, Shri Chakravarthi has denied 
to have received any such message at the relevant time. According 
to Shri Chakravarthi, a member of a minority community from 
Ahmedabad had telephoned him at about 1400 hrs on 28.02.2002, 
about an attack on late Ahesan Ja fri, Ex - MP's house and that he had 
immediately telephoned CP, Ahmedabad City in the matter, to which 
CP, Ahmedabad city, had informed that he had already sent officers 
and additional reinforcements to deal with the situation. Shri 
Chakravarhti has also st ated that a fax message was also sent by the 
State Control Room to CP, Ahmedabad City at 1405 hrs on 
28.02.2002 in this regards. On looking into the photo copy genuine 
of handwritten fax message bearing No. C/D -2/BANAO/178/2002, 
dated 28.02.2002 in Gujarat i, Shri Chakravarthi has stated that the 
language of the said fax message shows that the Gulberg Society 
incident was reported for the first time through this message after 
the occurrence of the incident on 28.02.2002, which proves the 
falsity of earlier m essage No. D -2 /2 -COM / ALERT / 174 / 2002 
dated 28.02.2002 claimed to have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt.  
Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP, Ahmedabad City, has stated that 
it was well within his knowledge after the meeting of 27.02.2002 
night held at CM's re siden ts, that the dead bodies of the kar -sevaks 
killed in the Godhra incident were being brought to Ahmedabad City 
with a view to facilitate the relatives of the deceased to identify and 
claim the dead bodies. As such there was no need for Shri Sanjiv 
Bhat t to send a fax message No.D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/100/2002, dated 
27.02.2002 to him. He denied having received any such fax message 
in his office on the night intervening 27/28.02.2002 as he remained 
in his office in Shahibaug till about 0100 hrs on 28.02.2002. H e 
further denied seeing any such message. He has also denied having 
received or seen fax message No. D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/174/2002, 442  
 
dated 28.02.2002. He has given the details of the additional 
force/officers sent by him on receipt of the messages from Sr. PI, 
Meghaninagar regarding the surrounding of Gulberg Society by a 
mob. He has also stated that the DGP might have spoken to him 
about the situation in Gulberg Society and also about the declaration 
of curfew, to which he was informed that the curfew had been 
declared in Chamanpura Chowky area around 1220 hrs. Shri Pande 
is of the view that both these fax messages now claimed to have been 
sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI, are false and fabricated 
documents. According to Shri Pande, this message was only m arked 
to him for information, though he was required to take action on the 
same and send a situation report. Shri Pande has denied sending any 
situation report with regard to the Gulberg Society matter to the 
SCR, Gandhinagar as the message was never sent to him. As regards 
the message No.C/D -2/BANAO/178/2002, dated 28.02.2002 
handwritten in Gujarati and signed by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, Shri Pande 
has stated that this message could have been sent only after the 
incident had taken place at Gulberg Society, and t he very fact that 
it did not contain any reference to the alleged earlier message No. 
174 claimed to have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt would go to show 
that the said message was not a genuine one and appears to have 
been manipulated subsequently .  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shri O.P. Mathur, the then IGP (Political & Communal), has 
stated that fax message No.D2/2 -COM/ALERT/100/2002, dated 
27.02.2002 does not have any security classification and in case it 
passed through the Control Room, it should have contained details 
about  the time and date. Further, the fax message does not bear the 
date and time at which it was passed on to the authorities, and as 
such it can not be said as to whether the said message was actually 
passed on to the concerned authorities or not. Also, accor ding to Shri 
Mathur, the language of the fax message does not show as to under 
whose instructions the said message was sent and who informed Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt as to what had transpired in the meeting, because in the 
said message did not say that Shri Sanji v Bhatt had himself attended 
the said meeting. Had Shri Sanjiv Bhatt attended the said meeting, 
he was duty bound to submit a report in writing to Addl. DG(Int.) on 
28.02.2002, when Shri G.C Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.) was very 
much in the office. Shr i Mathur has further stated that the said fax 
443  
 
message had not been marked to anyone including himself. After 
looking into his alleged initials dated 28.02.2002 on the office copy 
of the typed fax message dated 27.02.2002 claimed to have been sent 
by Shri S anjiv Bhatt, Shri Mathur has stated that the said initials 
were not his and the same had been fabricated by someone, as the 
message was not marked to him. Shri Mathur has also stated that 
had it been genuine paper, he would have marked the same to Addl. 
DG (Int.) for his information (being the overall Head of Intelligence 
wing) as Shri G.C. Raiger was very much in the office on 28.02.2002. 
Shri Mathur finally stated that the said fax message was a forged 
document, which had been fabricated subsequently by s omeone with 
a vested interest. He has denied receiving the message No. D -2/2 -
COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 28.02.2002 in English allegedly sent 
by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to different authorities.  
Shri G.C. Raiger, the then Addl. DG (Int.) has stated that the 
typed  fax message No. D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 
28.02.2002 was never put up to him on 28.02.2002 for perusal, and 
his initials dated 28.02.2002 on the said message are fabricated. He 
has stated that the said message was never seen by him and that it 
was a  fabricated document. He has also stated that another typed fax 
message No.D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/I00/2002, dated 27.02.2002 
claimed to have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to different 
authorities was neither put up to him for his information nor shown 
to him. He  was also not orally informed about the same by Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt. However Shri Raiger has stated that on 28.02.2002 afternoon, 
Shri Sanjiv Bhatt came to his chamber and conveyed a message based 
on a report from local IB unit, Ahmedabad City about the coll ection 
of a mob outside Gulberg Society, where late Ahesan Jafri, Ex -MP was 
residing and also about the inadequate presence of police on the 
spot. Shri Raiger has stated that the said message was passed on to 
the Ahmedabad City Police Control Room. Further , according to Shri 
Raiger, he along with Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, met the DGP immediately 
and informed him about the developing situation at Gulberg Society. 
Shri Raiger further stated that the DGP was requested to impress 
upon the CP, Ahmedabad City to declare  curfew in the area. To this, 
DGP immediately responded by telephonically speaking to Shri P.C. 
Pande the then CP, Ahmedabad City to ascertain the factual position 
CP, Ahmedabad , Shri Pande informed the D GP over phone that a 
curfew had already been imposed . Shri Raiger has also stated that 
after meeting the DGP, there was no reason for Shri Sanjiv Bhatt to 
send such a fax message on 28.02.2002. After going through the 444  
 
message No.C/D -2/BANAO/178/2002, dated 28.02.2002 
handwritten in Gujarati and bearing the signature of Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt, Shri Raiger has stated that the said message does not contain 
any reference to message No.D -2 /2 -COM/ALERT/ 174/2002, dated 
28.02.2002 claimed to have been sent earlier during the day by Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt. This would go to s how that the message No. D -2/2 -
COM/ALERT/174 /2002, dated 28.02.2002 was not a genuine one.  
Shri P.B. Upadhyay, the then Depu ty Commissioner in charge 
of Communal section has stated that he had proceeded on leave on 
26.02.2002. However, Shri O.P.Mathur, th e then IGP (Admn. & 
Security), who held the additional charge of the post of IGP(P & C) 
spoke to him over phone and cancelled his leave, with instructions 
to report immediately for duty in the light of Godhra train carnage 
incident. Shri Upadhyay according ly reported for duty in the office 
on 27.02.2002 evening around 1700 hrs or so. He has further stated 
that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the then DCI (Security) looked after his work 
in his absence and had sent some messages during the day 
(27.02.2002.). He has also stated that he remained in the office till 
late hours of 27.02.2002 as he stayed in Gandhinagar and that Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt left the office earlier than him as he used to live in 
Ahmedabad city. He has denied complete knowledge about the two -
typed fax messa ges No.D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/100/2002, dated 
27.02.2002 and D -2/2 -COM/ ALER T/174/2002, dated 28.02.2002 in 
English, and has stated that neither Shri Sanjiv Bhatt informed him 
about it nor these messages were shown to him. According to Shri 
P.B. Upadhyay, these m essages do not appear to be genuine, as the 
dispatch number had been typed, which was quite  
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Page: 465 
unusual as all dispatch numbers used to be put down in hand by the 
dispatcher. According to Shri P.B. Upadhyay, had such message been 
issued either on 27 .02.2002 or 28.02.2002, the same would have 
definitely been put up to him for perusal as he used to han dle the 
'Communal' subject in the office as per the then division of work. He 
has also stated that the initials dated 28.02.2002 of Shri O.P. Mathur 
on the fax message dated 27.02.2002 do not appear to be genuine. 
Shri P.B. Upadhyay has also stated that th e very fact that the 
message dated 28.02.2002 was addressed to PS to CM and PS to MoS 
(Home) and on which CP, Ahmedabad City was to take action, to 
whom only a copy was marked, would go to show that the message 
445  
 
was not a genuine one. He has denied knowledg e about a meeting at 
CM's residence on 27.02.2002 evening and that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt 
also did not inform him on 28.02.2002 of having attended any 
meeting with the CM in the night of 27.02.2002.  
Shri Iftekhar Ahemad V. Pathan, AIO, who is posted to D -2 
sect ion (Communal section) of State IB since 2000, has stated that 
the office copies of fax messages No.D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/100/2002, 
dated 27.02.2002 and D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 
28.02.2002 typed in English are not available on records of D -2 
section and t hat he had never seen the same. He has further stated 
that these messages were not dispatched from the dispatch register 
from the office of State IB and proved that the dispatch No. 100 
related to a letter dated 02.03.2002 sent by Shri P.B. Upadhyay to 
ACS (Home) regarding I Cr.No. 9/02 u/s 302 IPC of Khanpur P.S. 
Distt. Panchmahals, and dispatch No. 174 related to a fax message 
sent by Add. DG (int.) to Shri B.K. H aldar, Jt. Secretary, MHA, New 
Delhi on 16.03.2002 regarding communal incidents reported up t o 
16.03 .2002. According to Shri Pathan, the very fact that the dispatch 
numbers had been typed would show that the messages are false and 
bogus. He has further stated that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt did not come to 
State IB office late in the evening of 27.02.2002 while he was in the 
office till quite late. He has proved that fax message No.C/D -
2/BANAO/178/2002, dated 28.02.2002, handwritten in Gujarati, to 
be in the handwriting of Shri Bharatsinh Rathod and signed by Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt, was a genuine message and a c opy of the same was 
available in D -2 branch. The same does not contain any reference of 
either message No D -2/2 - COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 28.02 .2002 
claimed to have been sent by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, which appears to be 
bogus.  
Shri V.M. Sonar, the then PI an d Shri S.R. Shukla, the then IO 
of State IB, who were posted to D -2 Branch and were present in the 
office on 27.02.2002 & 28.02.2002 have corroborated the statement 
of Shri I.V. Pathan, AIO, D -2 branch, State IB.  
Shri Bharatsinh Rathod, the then AIO, State  IB Control Room, 
who was on duty from 0800 hrs to 2000 hrs on 28.02.2002, has 
stated that the fax message No.  C/D -2/BANAO/178/2002, dated 
28.02.2002 was in his hand writing and was written to the dictation 
of Shri E.L. Christian, the then PI, State IB Con trol Room, who had 
received the said information over telephone from IB, Ahmedabad 
Region. Shri Rathod has stated that Shri Christian took this message 
personally to Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, who signed the same in Gujarati. He 446  
 
has further stated that he put down  the dispatch No.178 from the 
Control Room dispatch register in his hand writing and passed on 
the same to the fax operator for transmission to the concerned 
authorities. However, he does not recollect the exact time of the 
receipt of the said message, but  it was certainly after the incident 
had taken place at the Gulberg Society . On looking into the photo 
copy of the office copy of fax message No.D -2/2 -
COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 28.02.2002 in English, he has stated 
that the message does not bear State IB Co ntrol Room dispatch 
number, which was essential had the same been dispatched from D -
2 branch. He has denied having seen or passed on the said fax 
message. His version has been corroborated by Shri E.L. Christian , 
the then PI, State IB Control Room.  
Shri A. S. Kasiri, the then PI, State IB Control Room has stated 
to have sent the Control Room messages No. D -2/2 -
COM/ALERT/172/2002, dated 27.02.2002 and D -2/ 2 -
COM/ALERT/173/2002, dated 27.02.2002 during his day duty hours 
from 0800 hrs to 2000 hrs on 27.02.2002  and has confirmed his 
signature thereon.  
Shri N.M. Gohil, the then AlO, State IB Control Room has 
confirmed writing the fax messages No. D -2/2 -COM/Kar -
Sevak/78/2002, dated 28.02.2002 & D -2/2 -COM/ Kar -
Sevak/80/2002, dated 27.02.2002 and has identified the signature 
of Shri V.J. Solanki, the then PI, State IB Control Room on the same. 
Shri V. J. Solanki could not be examined, because he is unable to 
speak or walk following a paralytic attack.

To sum up, on the basis of the further investigation conducted 
into the two typed fax messages NO.D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/100/2002, 
dated 27.02.2002 and D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 
28.02.2002, it is conclusively established that Shri Sanjiv Bhatt, the 
then DCI , did not produce the same or copies thereof before any of 
the authorities before December, 2011, though a number of 
opportunities arose for him to do so. From the records of D -2 section, 
it is conclusively established that one of these fax messages were 
issued/dispatched from the said section of State IB dealing with the 
447  
 
communal affairs. Besides that Shri P.B. Upadhyay, the then 
DCI(Communal) and Shri I.V. Pathan, AIO, who is posted to D -2 
Section since the year 2000 till date, have categorically stated t hat 
neither of those two fax messages was issued from their section and 
that copies thereof are not available in the records of the State IB. 
Shri O.P. Mathur, the then IGP(P & C) has categorically stated that 
fax message NO.D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/100/2002, dated  27.02.2002 
was fabricated document and that his initials thereon are not 
genuine. Shri G.C. Raiger, the then Addl. D.G.(Int) has denied his 
initials on the fax message No. D -2/2 -COM/ALERT/174/2002, dated 
28.02.2002 and has stated that the same have been f orged by 
someone and that no such fax message was ever sent by Shri Sanjiv 
Bhatt. Shri Gordhan Zadafia, the then MoS (Home), Shri V.J.Patel, 
the then P.S. to MoS(Home), Dr. P.K. Mishra, the then Principal 
Secretary to Chief Minister, Shri Ashok Narayan, th e then ACS 
(Home) and Shri P.C. Pande, the then CP, Ahmedabad City, to whom 
the aforesaid fax messages were claimed to have been sent by Shri 
Sanjiv Bhatt, all have denied having received any such fax messages. 
The very fact that there is no reference to f ax message No. 174 dated 
28.02.2002 by Control Room in fax message No.178 actually sent on 
28.02.2002 after the Gulberg Society incident, would conclusively 
prove that no such message was sent earlier on 28.02.2002. The oral 
and documentary evidence availa ble on record would therefore 
conclusively prove that these fax messages now produced by Shri 
Bhatt have been fabricated subsequently with an ulterior motive, and 
have been produced by Shri Sanjiv Bhatt for the first time before the 
Nanavati Commission of Inquiry and subsequently before SIT in 
January, 2012. No reliance can, therefore, be placed upon both these 
fax messages.  
To sum up, Shri A.K. Malhotra, Member, SIT has conducted an 
inquiry into the complaint made by Smt. Jakia Nasim as per the 
orders of t he Hon’ble Supreme Court of India passed on 27.04.2009. 
In compliance to the said order a report was submitted by the SIT to 
the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 13.05.2010, in which further 
investigation u/s 173(8) Cr.PC was suggested to be conducted in 
respect of Shri Gordhan Zadafia, Shri M.K. Tandon, Jt. CP and Shri 
P.B. Gondia, DCP, Zone -IV, Ahmedabad City. Further investigation in 
the matter was conducted by the undersigned (Shri Himanshu 
Shukla, DCP, Crime Branch, Ahmedabad City) under the supervisi on 
of Shri Y.C. Modi, Addl. DG & Member, SIT and a report in the matter 
was submitted to the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 17.11.2010. Both 448  
 
the aforesaid reports were given to Shri Raju Ramchandran, Sr. 
Advocate, who had been appointed as Amicus Curiae in the m atter 
by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. The Amicus Curiae submitted 
his Interim Report in the matter to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 
India on 20.01.2011, vide which he suggested further investigation 
in respect of some of the issues.  
In compliance to the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme 
Court of India on 15.03.2011, to conduct further investigation into 
the matter u/s 173 (8) Cr.PC, Shri Himanshu Shukla, DCP, Crime 
Branch carried out further investigation under the overall 
supervision of Chairman, S IT Shri R.K. Raghavan, Shri Y.C. Modi, 
Addl. DG & Member, SIT and Shri A.K. Malhotra, Member, SIT and 
another report was submitted to the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India 
on 25.04.2011. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India handed over the 
said report to the Ld . Amicus Curiae for his examination and 
independent opinion.  
The Ld. Amicus Curiae accordingly examined the SIT reports 
and also interacted with some of the witnesses including the police
