3. Heard the learned  Counsel for parties at length.  3 
 
4. In my opinion, i t won’t be appropriate at this stage to 
deal with respective arguments and record findings , as it 
may ultimately affect the parties and their pending 
litigations.   However, on an overall conspectus of facts 
and  circumstances of the case s, the Transfer Petitions , 
being bereft of merit , are liable to be dismissed.  
5. Both the Transfer Petitions are accordingly 
dismissed.
